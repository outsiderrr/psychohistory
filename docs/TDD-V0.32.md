# Psychohistory — Technical Design Document

**Project Version:** V0.3
**Document Revision:** V0.32 (2026-05-09)
**Supersedes:** V0.31 (2026-05-08, post-L2-T0.A/B/C); V0.30 (2026-05-08, initial draft); internal V0.1 / V0.2 designs are deprecated.
**Project Thesis:** [Forecaster Scoreboard](L1-PLAN.md#project-thesis--forecaster-scoreboard) — Brier-based on-chain calibration reputation, niche pro-sumer.
**Audience:** Claude Code master planning conversation. This document is the single source of truth for architecture. Use it to decompose work into subtasks, each of which will be developed in independent conversations. The companion documents [docs/L1-PLAN.md](L1-PLAN.md) (L1 master plan, strategic decisions S1-S10), [docs/DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) (ADR-0001~0014), [docs/PROPOSITION_STANDARD.md](PROPOSITION_STANDARD.md) (QPS), and [docs/TODOS.md](TODOS.md) (deferred items) provide the full context.

## Revision History (V0.31 → V0.32)

V0.32 incorporates ADR-0008 through ADR-0014 driven by the L1 CEO Review (2026-05-09). The CEO review's framing shift (from "creating-an-PMF-startup" to "passion infra + option-on-success") surfaced strategic decisions S1-S10 ([L1-PLAN §4.B](L1-PLAN.md#4b-l1-ceo-review-战略决策2026-05-09-ratified)).

Spec patches:

- **§3** — References [QPS](PROPOSITION_STANDARD.md) (ADR-0014) as proposition design discipline; no spec change.
- **§5.6** — Pool 3 amount slice formula now weights by `score × pool1Payout` (was `pool1Payout` alone). Aligns with Forecaster Scoreboard thesis: every distribution multiplies by score (ADR-0008).
- **§9** —
  - `Prediction.predictedValue` and `Bounty.resolvedValue` change `uint256 → int256` to support signed numerical events (ADR-0009).
  - New `CumulativeBrierStats` struct + `forecasterStats` mapping for cross-bounty cumulative forecaster rating (ADR-0010).
  - `Bounty` adds `tvlCap` field; new `MAX_BOUNTY_TVL_CAP_DEFAULT = 10_000 × 1e6` constant (ADR-0011).
  - All upgradeable contracts inherit `PausableUpgradeable`; new `paused` storage from OZ (ADR-0012).
  - `Treasury` adds pending-withdrawal storage (`pendingWithdrawals` mapping, `launchPeriodActive` flag) for time-locked admin outflows (ADR-0013).
- **§10.1** — `IBountyManager.createBounty` adds `tvlCap` parameter; `addSponsorship` enforces TVL cap (ADR-0011); new error `BountyTvlCapExceeded`.
- **§10.2** — `IPredictionEngine.submitPrediction` parameter `predictedValue` becomes `int256`; `resolve` parameter `resolvedValue` becomes `int256` (ADR-0009). New view functions `getForecasterStats`, `getForecasterAverageScore`, `getForecasterWinRate` (ADR-0010). New `Paused` / `Unpaused` events from OZ inheritance; functions gated by `whenNotPaused` (ADR-0012).
- **§10.4** — `ITreasury` adds `scheduleDaoWithdrawal` / `executeDaoWithdrawal` / `cancelDaoWithdrawal` time-lock pattern (ADR-0013); adds `endLaunchPeriod()` admin function. Existing `daoWithdraw` deprecated in favor of schedule/execute pair while `launchPeriodActive`.
- **§11** — Pass 1 numerical scoring uses `SignedMath.abs(predicted - actual)` for int256 inputs (ADR-0009). Pass 4 amount slice formula updated to `(alloc/2) × (score_i × pool1Payout_i) / Σ(score_j × pool1Payout_j)` (ADR-0008). Pass 4 / Final Finalization adds per-predictor update of `forecasterStats` (only on successful settlement; not on Invalidated / Cancelled / NoSignal paths) (ADR-0010). TVL cap check noted in submission flow context (ADR-0011).
- **§13** — Deployment script initializes `launchPeriodActive = true` on Treasury; all upgradeable proxies use Pausable initialization (ADR-0012, ADR-0013). DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE is the pauser (no separate PAUSER_ROLE in V0.3).
- **§14** — Tests added for: TVL cap enforcement (ADR-0011), Pause/unpause behavior (ADR-0012), withdrawal time-lock + sunset (ADR-0013), int256 negative-value submission/resolution (ADR-0009), forecaster stats update on settlement (ADR-0010), Brier-aligned amount slice math (ADR-0008).

The V0.31 internal "Post-T0.B review revisions" block remains valid; V0.32 supersedes V0.31 as the active TDD revision but does not invalidate V0.31's ratifications.

## Revision History (V0.30 → V0.31)

V0.31 incorporates the L1.B / L1.C output:

- **§1, §8** — Sponsor value proposition rewritten from "cryptographic secrecy of early signal" to "analytics SLA + standardized aggregate API + timeliness/format advantage + service priority". V0.3 走 B 路（透明） + 留 5 条 V0.4 升级架构口子。
- **§3, §5.2** — Numerical score direction unified: all settlement uses high-score-is-better.
- **§5.4** — Renamed *principal protection* → *net-of-fee principal protection*; all Pool 1 math based on `effectiveWager = wager × 0.99`.
- **§5.5** — Slice A fallback for empty bottom group routes to DAO sub-account under new category `P2_UNALLOCATED`.
- **§5.6** — `p1RemainderShareExcluded` removed; amount-pool weight is the explicit `pool1Payout = effectiveWager + remainderShare`.
- **§5.7** — Platform fee model: 1% deducted at submission (each predictor's `effectiveWager = wager × 0.99`); no edge-case underflow.
- **§5.9** — Zero-predictor case clarified: sponsors refund via `claimSponsorshipRefund()` (consistent with §8.4); no implicit invalidation. Score-0 fallback added (avoid division by zero).
- **§6.4** — `K` defined as WAD-scaled PSYH-per-USDC (`kWad`); allocation formula `usdcRaw × kWad / 1e6`. Monthly cap reservation moved from settlement-time global mutation to per-bounty `reserveRewards()` lock-in.
- **§6.5** — Buyback formula explicitly geometric ("rolling smoothing", `1/12` of current balance per epoch); no tranche queue.
- **§9** — `Prediction` adds `rawWager / effectiveWager / feeAmount` and `bytes encryptedPayload`. `Bounty` adds `PrivacyMode privacyMode`. `SettlementState` adds `currentPass / passCompletedFlags / cutoffHintSubmitted / cutoffHintScore`. New constants: `MAX_SPONSORS_PER_BOUNTY = 100`, `K_WAD_*` schedule.
- **§10.1** — `IBountyManager` adds PE-only mutators (`recordPrediction / closeBounty / markResolved / markSettled / markInvalidated`); `addSponsorship` enforces 100-sponsor cap; `SponsorRefundClaimed` event carries reason code.
- **§10.2** — `IPredictionEngine.submitPrediction` adds `bytes encryptedPayload` parameter; new `submitCutoffHint()`; reward claim path unified via `claim()`.
- **§10.3** — `IRewardDistributor` rewritten as 4-function reserve/assign/finalize/claim API; cap consumed at reserve, not at claim.
- **§10.4** — `ITreasury` adds `P2_UNALLOCATED` category; per-category balance accounting.
- **§11** — Settlement passes use `effectiveWager`; cutoff hint固化 as permissionless + on-chain paginated verification; final finalization uses commit-then-paginated token reward (matches §10.3 reserve/assign).
- **§12.4** — Removed "predictions are private" claim. Front-end opacity is convention, not security boundary.
- **§12.5** — Cutoff hint trust model fixed to permissionless.
- **§13** — Deploy split into `DeployCore.s.sol` (Phase 1) + `DeployBuyback.s.sol` (Phase 3).
- **§14** — Tests added for sponsor cap, score-0 fallback, effectiveWager invariants, RewardDistributor reserve/assign/finalize, encryptedPayload empty-check.
- **§15** — T4.3 split into a/b/c/d/e (五段); L2-T5 split into Router (T5.1) + BuybackExecutor (T5.2). Operational details, see [docs/L1-PLAN.md](L1-PLAN.md).

### Post-T0.B review revisions

The L2-T0.B GPT-5.5 review surfaced a set of cross-reference, atomicity, and decision-resolution gaps. The patches below are applied internally to V0.31 (document revision unchanged; these are refinements within the same spec).

- **§4.3** — Interaction flow synced with §10.x: `createBounty` (not createProposition); Pool 2 split written `30/30/20/10/10`; reward path written `reserveRewards → assignRewards → finalizeRewards → claimTokens` (not `distributeRewards`); explicit `closeBounty()` and `submitCutoffHint()` rows added.
- **§5.2** — Numerical scoring: `score = WAD_SQUARED / max(rawError, MIN_BRIER)` is the canonical output; the residual "Lower rawError is better" prose removed for consistency with §5.3 / §11 Pass 1.
- **§5.8** — Invalidation refund clarified to **`effectiveWager` refund** (D1-b ratification): the 1% submission fee committed to `Treasury.CAT_FEE` at submission is non-refundable; no Treasury fee clawback path. Sponsors still get 100% deposit refund.
- **§6.4** — Event name aligned with §10.3: `KCoefficientObserved(month, kWad)` (was `KCoefficientUpdated`).
- **§9** — `Prediction.inTopGroup` storage field removed (Opt-α design); top-group membership computed lazily in Pass 3/4. `K_WAD_PHASE5/6` written as compilable Solidity literals (`5e17` / `25e16`); the encoding caveat note is no longer needed.
- **§10.1** — `SponsorCapReached` declared as a Solidity custom `error` (not an `event`); semantic was already "reverted on 101st new sponsor".
- **§10.2** — Added `closeBounty(bountyId)` permissionless passthrough. `submitCutoffHint` natspec updated to permit overwriting a failed hint with counter-reset semantics (D2-b). `resolveAsInvalid` natspec clarifies fee non-refundability.
- **§11** — Pass 2 rewritten: hint replaceable on verification failure; per-prediction `inTopGroup` writes removed; counters reset on overwrite. Pass 3 / Pass 4 derive top-group membership lazily as `score >= topGroupCutoffScore`. Added explicit "State initialization & mirroring" and "Events emitted during settlement" subsections (clarifies `SettlementProgressed` / `NoSignalSettled` / `SettlementComplete` emit timing). Pool 2 splits documented as per-call recompute (not persisted on `SettlementState`).
- **§14** — Invalidation test updated to assert `effectiveWager` refund (not full raw refund) and `CAT_FEE` invariance. Cutoff hint replacement test added (D2-b + Opt-α). `closeBounty` passthrough test added. `SponsorCapReached` matcher updated to custom error.
- **§15** — `T3.1` references `pullBuybackForEpoch()` (not `scheduleBuyback`); `T3.2` describes `reserve/assign/finalize/claim` lifecycle (not "monthly cap with auto-reduction"); `T6.1` references `DeployCore.s.sol` + `DeployBuyback.s.sol` (not `Deploy.s.sol`).

**Two new ratified mini-decisions** (not part of the original L1.C five):
- **D1-b** — invalidation refunds `effectiveWager` only; submission fee is non-refundable. Trade-off: marginal user perception ("99% refund") in exchange for zero new Treasury attack surface and zero new fee-clawback path.
- **D2-b + Opt-α** — cutoff hint is replaceable on verification failure; top-group membership computed lazily, no `inTopGroup` storage. Trade-off: a few hundred extra gas per prediction in Pass 3/4 (lazy comparison) in exchange for failure recovery in O(minutes) instead of bounty-stuck-requiring-oracle-invalidation.

## 1. Design Philosophy & Positioning

Psychohistory is a decentralized prediction protocol that combines three elements absent from existing predictions markets:

1. **Unified discrete-and-quantitative framework.** Predictors always submit a structured prediction (probability distribution for discrete events, numeric value for quantitative events) paired with a free-form wager amount. Polymarket's AMM architecture cannot natively express quantitative predictions. This is the primary technical moat.
2. **Score-ranked settlement with top-50% cutoff.** Not "correct direction wins" (Polymarket), not "proportional to confidence" (soft ranking). Instead: only predictors in the top-50% score bracket share Pool 1 and Pool 3. Bottom-50% receives only a consolation slice of the sponsor pool. This enforces hard differentiation between good and mediocre predictions.
3. **Sponsor-funded analytics tier.** Sponsors fund a secondary prize pool and receive staggered post-close delivery of curated aggregate analytics — clean schema, machine-readable API, timeliness/format guarantees, and human/AI support priority. The auction equilibrium price reflects the value of analytics convenience and SLA, not cryptographic secrecy. Predictions are accepted to be on-chain transparent in V0.3; sponsors do not pay for exclusive information access. (Optional V0.4 upgrade may add encrypted submission and threshold/oracle decryption to recover an information-asymmetry tier; V0.3 ships with architectural hooks to enable that upgrade without rewrite — see §9 `PrivacyMode`, §10.2 `encryptedPayload`.)

**What Psychohistory is NOT:**

- Not an AMM. No market-making, no continuous price discovery during the prediction window, no liquidity pools. Predictions lock at submission and settle once at resolution.
- Not a pure PvP casino. Sponsor pool creates a third source of funds beyond loser stakes, enabling sustainable value flow even in low-volume markets.
- Not a fully decentralized protocol at launch. Proposition creation is centralized (team-curated). Decentralized challenge mechanisms are deferred to future phases.
- **Not (in V0.3) a privacy-preserving protocol.** All predictions, wagers, and aggregates are derivable from on-chain state by anyone willing to run an indexer. Front-ends must not represent prediction privacy as a security feature. See §12.4.

**Primary user personas:**

- **Predictors:** Individual users submitting predictions with real USDC wagers. Motivated by (a) winning other predictors' wagers (Pool 1 + Pool 2 victory bonus), (b) sponsor pool consolation (bottom-50%), (c) earning $PSYH tokens through prediction mining (top-50% only).
- **Sponsors:** Entities that fund a prediction with USDC in exchange for staggered access to a curated aggregate-analytics service. Motivated by (a) saving the ~$5K–$50K engineering and ongoing-maintenance cost of a private indexer, (b) format/SLA reliability for downstream products, (c) timeliness within minutes of close vs. hours-to-days of DIY indexing, (d) optional analyst/AI support priority. Sponsors are NOT paying for cryptographic exclusivity in V0.3.
- **Arbitrageurs:** A subset of predictors and sponsors who exploit divergences between Psychohistory's aggregated signal and external markets like Polymarket. Psychohistory's signal is valuable whether it is more accurate or less accurate than Polymarket, as long as it is independent — this enables bidirectional arbitrage and removes the pressure to "beat Polymarket" as a cold-start requirement.

## 2. Tech Stack & Conventions

- **Solidity:** ^0.8.20 (toolchain configured for 0.8.27)
- **Framework:** Foundry (forge, cast, anvil)
- **Libraries:** OpenZeppelin Contracts Upgradeable v5.x, OpenZeppelin Contracts v5.x
- **Upgradeability:** Transparent Proxy pattern for all stateful contracts. `BrierMath` and other pure libraries are linked at compile time and do not use proxies.
- **Math:** All multiplication-then-division uses `Math.mulDiv` to prevent intermediate overflow. Fixed-point representations use WAD (1e18) for continuous values and BPS (10,000) for probabilities.
- **Token transfers:** `SafeERC20` everywhere. No direct `transfer` / `transferFrom` calls.
- **Reentrancy:** `nonReentrant` on every function that moves tokens. Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern throughout.
- **Storage safety:** `uint256[50] private __gap;` at end of every upgradeable contract.
- **Emergency pause (V0.32 / ADR-0012):** all upgradeable contracts inherit `PausableUpgradeable`. `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` may call `pause()` / `unpause()`. User entry-paths (e.g., `submitPrediction`, `addSponsorship`, `createBounty`, `settle`, `submitCutoffHint`, `executeEpoch`) gated by `whenNotPaused`. **Exit-paths NOT gated**: `claim`, `claimSponsorshipRefund`, `claimTokens`, `daoWithdraw` (or scheduled withdrawals) remain callable during pause to let users / admin rescue funds.
- **License:** `// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT` on every file.
- **NatSpec:** Required on every external/public function.

**Token specifications:**

- **USDC:** 6 decimals. Used for all stakes, sponsor pools, and payouts.
- **$PSYH:** 18 decimals. Native governance and reward token.

**Environment assumptions:**

- Target chain: any EVM-compatible chain with USDC support (Ethereum mainnet, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, etc.)
- Oracle: single `ORACLE_ROLE` held by a multisig or the team at launch. Decentralized oracle is a future upgrade.

## 3. Proposition Types

There are exactly two proposition types. This is a deliberate simplification from earlier designs that had three types.

> **Proposition curation discipline (V0.32 / ADR-0014).** All Psychohistory propositions — regardless of type — must satisfy the **[Qualified Proposition Standard (QPS)](PROPOSITION_STANDARD.md)**: single authoritative public source, source named in metadata, unambiguous value definition, unambiguous resolution timing, prebuilt failure clause. The protocol does **not** enforce QPS in contract logic (it's a curation principle, not a runtime check), but every team-curated bounty in V0.3 and every sponsor self-service bounty in V0.4+ must pass the QPS curator review checklist. The benefit: proposition resolutions become *Schelling-point* — any honest observer reaches identical conclusion — which eliminates owner-as-oracle subjective interpretation risk and paves the way for future oracle decentralization.

### 3.1 Discrete Propositions

Applicable to any event with `N` mutually exclusive outcomes, where `2 ≤ N ≤ MAX_OPTIONS (5)`.

- Traditional binary (Yes/No) is simply `N=2`, handled by the same code path as `N=3,4,5`.
- Predictor input:
  - `selectedOption`: unused for scoring purposes (see note below).
  - `confidenceBpsArray`: an array of `N` integers in basis points, must sum to exactly `10_000`.
  - `wagerAmount`: USDC amount, minimum 1 USDC (1e6 raw).
- Scoring: Brier distance `BS = Σ(f_j - o_j)²` over all `j ∈ [0, N)`, where `o_j = WAD` if option `j` is the resolved outcome, else `0`. Lower is better. Range `[0, 2×WAD]`.

**Note on `selectedOption`:** In earlier V2 design, discrete predictions had both a `selectedOption` (for win/loss) and a `confidenceBpsArray` (for Brier weighting). In this V3 design, the `selectedOption` concept is eliminated. The Brier score alone determines ranking — a predictor's full probability distribution is always used. This is philosophically cleaner: we reward calibrated probabilistic thinking, not binary correctness. Users in UI may still be guided by a "primary choice" field, but on-chain only the `confidenceBpsArray` matters.

### 3.2 Numerical Propositions

Applicable to any event with a continuous numeric outcome, **including signed values** (V0.32 / ADR-0009).

- Predictor input:
  - `predictedValue`: **scaled signed integer (`int256`)**. Supports both positive and negative values (e.g., election margin where positive = Dem net gain, negative = Rep net gain; year-over-year delta where negative = decline).
  - `predictedDecimals`: decimal precision (≤18).
  - `wagerAmount`: USDC amount, minimum 1 USDC.
- Scoring (intermediate): normalized absolute error. Given WAD-scaled signed predicted value `p` and signed resolved value `a`, raw error is `|p - a|` computed via `SignedMath.abs(p - a)` returning `uint256`. The raw error is never used directly for ranking; it is converted to a unified high-score-is-better `score` per §5.2.

### 3.3 Unification

Both types resolve into a **single sortable `score` value per prediction, where higher is always better.** This direction is uniform across all settlement logic — Pass 1 score computation, Pass 2 cutoff determination, Pass 3/4 weighted allocation, Pool 3 token reward weights — there is no place in the protocol where "lower is better" applies. `BrierMath` exposes distinct scoring functions for Discrete and Numerical but normalizes both to high-is-better before returning. The settlement pipeline is therefore type-agnostic once `score` is computed. See §5.2 for the unification formulas.

## 4. Contract Architecture

### 4.1 Contract Topology

| Contract | Type | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `BrierMath.sol` | Library (linked) | Pure math: Brier score, normalized error, ranking-based payout helpers |
| `Treasury.sol` | Proxy | Accumulates fees and sponsor-pool buyback allocations; executes TWAP buybacks & burns |
| `PsychohistoryToken.sol` | Non-upgradeable ERC20Votes | $PSYH token. Mint-gated by `MinterRole`. Transfers toggleable by phase. |
| `RewardDistributor.sol` | Proxy | Computes and mints $PSYH rewards post-settlement. Holds the 40% mining allocation. |
| `BountyManager.sol` | Proxy | Proposition lifecycle: creation, sponsor deposits, state machine, sponsor refund logic |
| `PredictionEngine.sol` | Proxy | Prediction submission, resolution, paginated settlement, payout claim |
| `BuybackExecutor.sol` | Proxy | Executes TWAP buybacks on Uniswap V3 / CoW Protocol. Controlled by Treasury. |
| `PsychohistoryRouter.sol` | Proxy | Thin facade for multi-step atomic operations |

### 4.2 Access Control Roles

```
DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE            → Multisig (or deployer at launch)
ORACLE_ROLE                   → Oracle multisig / team
PREDICTION_ENGINE_ROLE        → PredictionEngine proxy (granted on Treasury, RewardDistributor, BountyManager)
TREASURY_EXECUTOR_ROLE        → BuybackExecutor proxy (granted on Treasury for withdrawals)
MINTER_ROLE                   → RewardDistributor proxy (granted on PsychohistoryToken)
TRANSFER_CONTROLLER_ROLE      → DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE (controls PsychohistoryToken transfer toggle during phased rollout)
```

### 4.3 Interaction Flow

```
Sponsor   → BountyManager.createBounty()                         [initial sponsor deposit]
Sponsor   → BountyManager.addSponsorship()                       [bidding during open window]
Predictor → PredictionEngine.submitPrediction(...)               [wager in USDC; 1% fee → Treasury.CAT_FEE]
Anyone    → PredictionEngine.closeBounty(bountyId)               [Open → Closed; passthrough to BountyManager (§10.2)]
Oracle    → PredictionEngine.resolve() OR resolveAsInvalid()
Anyone    → PredictionEngine.submitCutoffHint(bountyId, score)   [§11 Pass 2; permissionless; may overwrite a previously failed hint]
Anyone    → PredictionEngine.settle(startIndex, endIndex)        [paginated; advances Pass 1 → Pass 2 → Pass 3 → Pass 4]
  ├─ Pass 1: score computation (per prediction)
  ├─ Pass 2: cutoff hint paginated verification (§11)
  ├─ Pass 3: aggregate accumulator + RewardDistributor.reserveRewards(bountyId, ...)
  ├─ Pass 4: per-predictor USDC payout assignment
  └─ Final finalization (triggered on the call that completes Pass 4):
       ├─ Pool 2 transfers: 30% consolation + 30% victory bonus per top/bottom predictor row
       ├─ Pool 2 platform: 20% buyback (Treasury.CAT_BUYBACK), 10% team (direct), 10% DAO (Treasury.CAT_DAO)
       ├─ Pool 2 Slice A redirect: if B = ∅, consolation → Treasury.CAT_P2_UNALLOCATED (§5.5)
       ├─ Pool 3: RewardDistributor.assignRewards(...) (paginated) then finalizeRewards()
       └─ BountyManager.markSettled(bountyId, topGroupCount)
Winner    → PredictionEngine.claim()                             [pull USDC payout AND atomically claims PSYH via RewardDistributor.claimTokens]
Sponsor   → BountyManager.claimSponsorshipRefund()               [only if Invalidated, Cancelled, or zero-predictor settled]
```

Pool 2 split is `30 / 30 / 20 / 10 / 10` (consolation / victory / buyback / team / DAO); see §5.5 for full pool semantics. Pool 3 lifecycle is `reserveRewards → assignRewards → finalizeRewards → claimTokens` (replaces V0.30's `distributeRewards` array call); see §10.3.

## 5. Three Prize Pools & Settlement Mathematics

This is the mathematical heart of the protocol. Every rule below must be implemented exactly as specified.

### 5.1 Pool Definitions

> **Wager terminology.** Throughout §5 and §11, `wager` (when used as a weight or in distribution math) refers to **`effectiveWager = rawWager × (1 - PLATFORM_FEE_BPS/10000) = rawWager × 0.99`**. The 1% fee is deducted at submission time once and the residual `effectiveWager` is the only quantity that participates in any subsequent math. `rawWager` is preserved for accounting/audit only. See §5.7 for the fee model and §9 `Prediction` struct for storage fields.

**Pool 1 — Predictor Wager Pool**
- Source: sum of all predictor `effectiveWager` for this proposition.
- Recipients: Top-50% predictors only.
- Distribution rule: detailed in §5.4.

**Pool 2 — Sponsor Pool**
- Source: sum of all sponsor deposits for this proposition.
- Split: `30% / 30% / 20% / 10% / 10%`
  - **30% consolation:** bottom-50% predictors, weighted by `score × effectiveWager`.
  - **30% victory bonus:** top-50% predictors, weighted by `score × effectiveWager`.
  - **20% buyback allocation:** transferred to Treasury under category `BUYBACK`.
  - **10% team allocation:** transferred to team wallet.
  - **10% DAO fund allocation:** transferred to Treasury under category `DAO`.

**Pool 3 — Token Reward Pool**
- Source: `RewardDistributor` mints from the 40% mining allocation, gated by per-bounty reservation against the monthly emission cap (see §6.4 and §10.3).
- Total tokens per proposition (reserved at settlement start):
  ```
  propositionTokenAllocation = (P1_rawTotal + P2_total) × kWad / 1e6
  ```
  where `kWad` is the WAD-scaled coefficient (see §6.4) and the divisor `1e6` converts USDC's 6-decimal unit to PSYH's 18-decimal unit. P1 uses raw (pre-fee) total here so that token incentive scales with full economic activity.
- Split: `50% / 50%`
  - **50% amount pool:** top-50% predictors, weighted by their Pool 1 winnings (`pool1Payout = effectiveWager + remainderShare`, see §5.4 and §5.6).
  - **50% quality pool:** top-50% predictors, weighted by `score × effectiveWager`.
- Bottom-50% predictors receive zero $PSYH.

### 5.2 Scoring Functions

**Discrete proposition:**
```
score = (2 × WAD) - computeCategoricalBrierScore(confidenceWadArray, resolvedOptionIndex)
```
Higher score is better. Range `[0, 2×WAD]`.

**Numerical proposition:**
```
rawError = computeAbsoluteError(predictedValueWad, resolvedValueWad)
score    = WAD_SQUARED / max(rawError, MIN_BRIER)
```
`score` is high-is-better and is the **only** quantity used for ranking, top-50% cutoff (§5.3), and all score-weighted allocation (Pool 2 consolation / victory and Pool 3 quality slice). `rawError` is an internal intermediate; `score` is the canonical numerical output, symmetric with the discrete case.

### 5.3 Ranking and Top-50% Cutoff

Rank all predictions in descending order by `score`.

Define the cutoff as follows. Let `n` be the total number of predictions.

- `targetCount = ceil(n / 2)`.
- Walk down the sorted list. The cutoff is the score at position `targetCount - 1` (0-indexed).
- **Include all ties:** every prediction with score `>= cutoffScore` is in the top group. This means the top group may exceed `targetCount` if ties span the cutoff.

**Example:** 10 predictors, scores `[100, 95, 95, 95, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30]`. Target count is 5. Position 4 (0-indexed) has score `80`. Cutoff is `80`. Top group includes all scores `>= 80`, which is positions 0–4 = 5 predictors. No ties span the cutoff in this case.

**Example with ties:** 10 predictors, scores `[100, 95, 90, 90, 90, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50]`. Target count is 5. Position 4 has score `90`. Cutoff is `90`. Top group includes all scores `>= 90`, which is 6 predictors (positions 0–5).

### 5.4 Pool 1 Distribution (Net-of-Fee Principal Protection + Remainder)

The rule below is *net-of-fee principal protection*: each top-group predictor is guaranteed back **`effectiveWager_i = rawWager_i × 0.99`**, never less. The 1% fee was already deducted at submission (§5.7) and lives in `Treasury` from the moment of submission; settlement does not re-touch it. This eliminates the V0.30 underflow edge case where `0.99 × rawTotal < topPrincipal` in all-tie / single-predictor scenarios.

Let:
- `P1_effectiveTotal = Σ effectiveWager_i over all i` = sum of all predictor effective wagers (already net of fee).
- `T` = set of top-50% predictors (by score cutoff rule in §5.3).
- `B` = set of bottom-50% predictors. `B` is empty in all-tie / single-predictor cases.
- `P1_principal = Σ effectiveWager_i for i ∈ T`.
- `P1_remainder = Σ effectiveWager_i for i ∈ B = P1_effectiveTotal - P1_principal`. (Always ≥ 0; equals 0 when `B = ∅`.)

Distribution:
1. Each `i ∈ T` first receives back their own `effectiveWager_i` (net-of-fee principal protection).
2. `P1_remainder` is distributed among `T` proportionally to `score_i × effectiveWager_i`:
   ```
   remainderShare_i = P1_remainder × (score_i × effectiveWager_i) / Σ(score_j × effectiveWager_j for j ∈ T)
   ```
   If `Σ(score_j × effectiveWager_j for j ∈ T) == 0` (degenerate: all top-group scores are 0), fall back to weighting by `effectiveWager_i` alone. If that sum is also 0 (impossible — `effectiveWager` is always ≥ `MIN_WAGER × 0.99`), revert.
3. Each `i ∈ T` receives `pool1Payout_i = effectiveWager_i + remainderShare_i`.

**Invariant (conservation):** `Σ pool1Payout_i for i ∈ T = P1_effectiveTotal`, modulo rounding dust which is swept to Treasury under category `DUST` at end of `settle()`.
**Invariant (no-loss):** Every `i ∈ T` receives ≥ `effectiveWager_i`. They never lose net-of-fee principal in Pool 1.
**Invariant (bottom-group):** Every `i ∈ B` receives `pool1Payout_i = 0`. Bottom-group predictors recover nothing from Pool 1; their consolation comes from Pool 2 Slice A only.

### 5.5 Pool 2 Distribution

Let `P2_total` = sum of all sponsor deposits for this proposition.

**Slice A — Consolation (30% of P2_total):**
- Distributed to bottom-50% predictors `B`.
- `P2_A_amount = P2_total × P2_CONSOLATION_BPS / BPS = P2_total × 0.30`.
- For each `i ∈ B`:
  ```
  consolation_i = P2_A_amount × (score_i × effectiveWager_i) / Σ(score_j × effectiveWager_j for j ∈ B)
  ```
- **Score-0 fallback:** if `Σ(score_j × effectiveWager_j for j ∈ B) == 0` (all bottom-group scores are 0; can occur when every bottom-group predictor's Brier score equals `2 × WAD`), fall back to weighting by `effectiveWager_i` alone within `B`. If `Σ effectiveWager_j for j ∈ B` is also 0 (impossible; `B ≠ ∅` implies at least one wager), revert.
- **Empty bottom group:** if `B = ∅` (all predictors are in top group due to ties or single-predictor case), `P2_A_amount` is **not** distributed and **not** routed to buyback or fee. It is transferred to Treasury under the new dedicated category `P2_UNALLOCATED` and settled into the DAO-controlled sub-account, joining Slice D2 funds operationally but tagged separately for accounting clarity. Rationale: auto-buyback would distort token monetary policy in all-tie/single-predictor scenarios; routing to DAO is monetary-neutral and lets future DAO governance decide use (e.g., airdrop, buyback, infrastructure grant). Pre-DAO this remains under admin multisig custody, identical to Slice D2 today.

**Slice B — Victory Bonus (30% of P2_total):**
- Distributed to top-50% predictors `T`.
- `P2_B_amount = P2_total × P2_VICTORY_BPS / BPS = P2_total × 0.30`.
- For each `i ∈ T`:
  ```
  victoryBonus_i = P2_B_amount × (score_i × effectiveWager_i) / Σ(score_j × effectiveWager_j for j ∈ T)
  ```
- **Score-0 fallback:** if `Σ(score_j × effectiveWager_j for j ∈ T) == 0` (degenerate; the entire top group scored 0), fall back to weighting by `effectiveWager_i` alone within `T`. By construction `T ≠ ∅` whenever any prediction exists.

**Slice C — Buyback (20% of P2_total):**
- Transferred to `Treasury` under category `BUYBACK`. Funds enter the geometric buyback queue (§6.5) and are gradually used to purchase and burn $PSYH on the open market once `BuybackExecutor.activate()` has been called (Phase 3 onward).

**Slice D1 — Team (10% of P2_total):**
- Transferred directly to team wallet address (configurable, set via `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`).

**Slice D2 — DAO Fund (10% of P2_total):**
- Transferred to `Treasury` under category `DAO`, accumulating in the DAO-controlled sub-account.
- Before DAO formation: admin multisig custody. Documented in whitepaper and on-chain metadata.

**Per-bounty Pool 2 invariant:**
```
Σ Slice A + Σ Slice B + Slice C + Slice D1 + Slice D2 = P2_total (modulo rounding dust)
```
Rounding dust is swept to Treasury under category `DUST`.

### 5.6 Pool 3 Distribution

Total token allocation for this proposition is reserved at the start of settlement (after Pass 2 completes and `T` is known) by calling `RewardDistributor.reserveRewards(bountyId, P1_rawTotal + P2_total)`. The reservation locks against the monthly emission cap immediately, preventing late-claim contention with other bounties (see §10.3 and §6.4).

```
propositionTokenAllocation = (P1_rawTotal + P2_total) × kWad / 1e6
```
where `kWad` is the WAD-scaled coefficient at reservation time (see §6.4); the divisor `1e6` converts USDC's 6-decimal raw amount to PSYH's 18-decimal raw amount. P1 raw (pre-fee) total is used so that the token-incentive scales with full economic activity, not net-of-fee.

**Slice A — Amount Pool (50% of allocation, V0.32 / ADR-0008 score-weighted):**
- Recipients: top-50% predictors `T`.
- Weight: **`score × pool1Payout`** (V0.32 change from V0.31's `pool1Payout`-only weighting). `pool1Payout_i = effectiveWager_i + remainderShare_i` is computed in §5.4. Sponsor Slice B (victoryBonus) is **not** included in the weight — Pool 3 amount slice rewards Pool-1-economic activity weighted by calibration.
- For each `i ∈ T`:
  ```
  amountTokens_i = (propositionTokenAllocation / 2) × (score_i × pool1Payout_i) / Σ(score_j × pool1Payout_j for j ∈ T)
  ```
- **Score-0 fallback:** if `Σ(score_j × pool1Payout_j for j ∈ T) == 0` (degenerate; entire top group scored 0), fall back to weighting by `pool1Payout_i` alone within `T`.
- **Rationale:** every Pool 3 distribution formula now multiplies by `score`, aligning with the Brier-philosophy "reward calibration, not stake size" thesis ([Forecaster Scoreboard](L1-PLAN.md#project-thesis--forecaster-scoreboard)). The amount slice differs from the quality slice in that it includes `remainderShare` (winnings from losers' wagers) in addition to base stake; quality slice uses pure `effectiveWager`. Both now align with calibration philosophy.

**Slice B — Quality Pool (50% of allocation):**
- Recipients: top-50% predictors `T`.
- Weight: `score_i × effectiveWager_i`.
- For each `i ∈ T`:
  ```
  qualityTokens_i = (propositionTokenAllocation / 2) × (score_i × effectiveWager_i) / Σ(score_j × effectiveWager_j for j ∈ T)
  ```
- **Score-0 fallback:** if `Σ(score_j × effectiveWager_j for j ∈ T) == 0`, fall back to weighting by `effectiveWager_i` alone within `T`.

Total tokens for predictor `i ∈ T`: `amountTokens_i + qualityTokens_i`.
Total tokens for predictor `i ∈ B`: `0`.

**Note on V0.30's `p1RemainderShareExcluded`:** Earlier draft §11 referenced a variable `p1RemainderShareExcluded` for this slice. That variable is **removed in V0.31**; the explicit `pool1Payout_i` defined in §5.4 is the single source of truth for Slice A's weight.

### 5.7 Platform Fee

A flat **1%** platform fee is collected on each prediction at submission time, not at settlement. This is the **per-predictor pre-deduction model** ratified in L1.C.

When a predictor submits a prediction with `rawWager` USDC:
```
feeAmount      = rawWager × PLATFORM_FEE_BPS / BPS = rawWager × 0.01   // rounded down
effectiveWager = rawWager - feeAmount                                    // exactly equals rawWager × 0.99 modulo rounding
```

`feeAmount` is transferred directly to `Treasury` under category `FEE` during `submitPrediction()`. `effectiveWager` is the only quantity that enters Pool 1 / Pool 2 / Pool 3 math thereafter; `rawWager` is preserved on the `Prediction` struct for accounting/audit but never participates in distribution.

Consequences (compared to V0.30's settlement-time fee deduction):
- **No principal-protection underflow.** §5.4 net-of-fee principal protection is mathematically tight; `effectiveTotal == Σ effectiveWager` by construction, so `effectiveTotal ≥ topPrincipal` always.
- **Protocol revenue is exactly 1% of `rawTotal`**, regardless of all-tie / single-predictor edge cases.
- **No branching in distribution code.** All formulas use `effectiveWager` uniformly.
- **Submission flow** must `transferFrom(predictor, Treasury, feeAmount)` and `transferFrom(predictor, address(this), effectiveWager)` atomically (or one combined transfer with internal split).

No fee on Pool 2 (sponsors already pay via the 20% buyback + 10% team + 10% DAO allocations, totaling 40% platform take).

**Invariant (per-predictor):** `rawWager_i = effectiveWager_i + feeAmount_i` always, exactly, with `feeAmount_i = rawWager_i × 100 / 10000` rounded down. Storage MUST persist all three for audit.

**Invariant (protocol total):** `Σ feeAmount_i for all i == platformFeeBalance(bountyId)` at any time.

### 5.8 Invalidation and Refund

If the oracle calls `resolveAsInvalid()`:

- **Predictors get `effectiveWager` refund** (= `rawWager × 0.99`, the same quantity that would have entered Pool 1 distribution). The 1% submission fee already committed to `Treasury.CAT_FEE` at submission (§5.7) is **non-refundable** under invalidation. Rationale: per-predictor pre-deduction (§5.7) commits the fee at submission as a one-way protocol-usage charge; a paid invalidation refund must not require Treasury fee clawback (which would add a new outbound role-gated path on Treasury and complicate accounting). Predictors are made aware of this in the front-end submission flow.
- **Sponsors get 100% deposit refund** via `BountyManager.claimSponsorshipRefund()` (Pool 2 platform take is only triggered by Pool 2 distribution, which does not run under invalidation; sponsor pools accrue zero protocol take when invalidated).
- No additional protocol take is collected at invalidation; only the previously committed `CAT_FEE` balance remains in Treasury.
- No ranking, no scoring, no $PSYH minting.
- `BountyState` transitions to `Invalidated` and is marked `Settled` immediately (refunds are pull-based; the eligibility predicate is permanent — see §10.1 `isRefundable` and `claimSponsorshipRefund`).

**Invariant.** `Σ effectiveWager_refunded == Σ effectiveWager_at_submission` (full refund of the post-fee principal, paid out of the PE-held escrow). `Σ feeAmount` previously routed to `Treasury.CAT_FEE` is unaffected by invalidation.

### 5.9 Edge Cases

- **Zero predictors at resolution (`totalPredictors == 0`).** No Pool 1 distribution (no Pool 1 funds — the fee was never collected because no predictions were ever submitted). Pool 2 is **fully refunded** to sponsors via `BountyManager.claimSponsorshipRefund()`. Slices A/B/C/D1/D2 do **not** execute; the bounty's terminal state is `Settled` with sponsor refund predicate. The refund event carries `reasonCode: NO_SIGNAL` (distinct from `INVALIDATED` and `CANCELLED` — see §10.1). This rule is consistent with §8.4 and supersedes V0.30 §5.9's contradictory "no refund either" prose.
- **All predictors tie.** If all `n` predictors have identical scores, they all enter `T` (ties include rule, §5.3); `B = ∅`. Pool 1 net-of-fee principal protection still works — each `i ∈ T` recovers `effectiveWager_i`; `P1_remainder == 0` so no additional Pool 1 distribution. Pool 2 Slice A → Treasury under `P2_UNALLOCATED` (§5.5). Pool 2 Slice B distributed via `effectiveWager_i` weighting (the score-0 fallback if all scores happen to be 0).
- **Only one predictor.** `T = {only}`, `B = ∅`. Same handling as "all tie."
- **All scores are 0** (degenerate). Possible for Discrete when every predictor's Brier score equals `2 × WAD`. The score-0 fallback rules in §5.4 / §5.5 / §5.6 apply (weight by `effectiveWager` alone). The bounty still settles deterministically.
- **Rounding dust.** All `mulDiv` operations round down. Residual dust at end of `settle()` is swept to Treasury under category `DUST`.
- **Encrypted payload (V0.4 path).** V0.3 settlement reads `confidenceBpsArray` / `predictedValue` directly from storage. V0.4 will route this through `_getPrediction(bountyId, predictor)` which can decrypt `encryptedPayload` based on `Bounty.privacyMode`. V0.3 implementations MUST already use the helper indirection so that V0.4 is a single helper-body change rather than a settlement rewrite (see §12.4 hooks list).

## 6. Token Economics

### 6.1 Token Specification

- **Name:** Psychohistory Token
- **Symbol:** PSYH
- **Standard:** ERC-20 + ERC20Votes (OpenZeppelin) + ERC20Permit
- **Decimals:** 18
- **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 PSYH (1 billion)
- **Upgradeable:** No. Deployed once, immutable. Proxy not used.

### 6.2 Allocation

| Bucket | Percentage | Amount | Vesting / Release |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prediction Mining | 40% | 400,000,000 | Cap, **not** pre-mint. Released on-demand via `RewardDistributor.MINTER_ROLE`, gated by §6.4 monthly cap and per-bounty reservation. |
| Team | 15% | 150,000,000 | 1-year cliff, 3-year linear vesting after |
| DAO Treasury | 20% | 200,000,000 | Locked; unlocked by DAO governance post-formation |
| Liquidity Reserve | 10% | 100,000,000 | Used for initial Uniswap pool seeding in Phase 3 |
| Airdrop / Marketing | 10% | 100,000,000 | Allocated over 4 years; early airdrops at milestones |
| Reserve | 5% | 50,000,000 | Contingency; no predefined schedule |

**Mining bucket model (decision 5).** The 400 M PSYH for Prediction Mining is **not pre-minted into `RewardDistributor`**. Instead `RewardDistributor` holds `MINTER_ROLE` on `PsychohistoryToken` and mints **on demand** when predictors call `claimTokens()`, accounting against an internal `mintingCapRemaining` counter initialized to `400_000_000 × 1e18` and decreasing with every successful claim. Consequences:
- `PsychohistoryToken.totalSupply()` exactly equals the cumulative quantity of PSYH that has flowed to predictors / liquidity / team / etc. — no inflated supply due to held-but-undistributed mining bucket.
- Compromise of the `RewardDistributor` proxy exposes at most the *next batch* of mints, not the entire 400 M reserve.
- The mining cap is enforced by `mintingCapRemaining` plus the §6.4 monthly cap; the token contract does **not** itself know about the 40% cap.

### 6.3 Transfer Gating

`PsychohistoryToken` has a `_transfersEnabled` boolean flag, initially `false`. Only `TRANSFER_CONTROLLER_ROLE` can flip it. Minting (by `RewardDistributor`) is always allowed. During Phase 1 (0–3 months post-launch), transfers are disabled; users accumulate but cannot move tokens.

See §7 for phased rollout schedule.

### 6.4 Mining Schedule

The `K` coefficient defines how many PSYH are minted per USDC of proposition volume. **`K` is stored on-chain WAD-scaled** as `kWad` (i.e., the human-readable value `K = 10` is encoded as `kWad = 10 × 1e18`). The Pool 3 allocation formula (§5.6) is:

```
propositionTokenAllocation = (P1_rawTotal + P2_total) × kWad / 1e6
```

The divisor `1e6` converts the USDC raw amount (6 decimals) so the result is in PSYH raw units (18 decimals). Worked example: `P1+P2 = 1 USDC = 1e6 raw`, `kWad = 10e18` → `allocation = 1e6 × 10e18 / 1e6 = 10e18 = 10 PSYH`.

**Schedule (`kWad` by month since `PsychohistoryToken` deployment):**

```
Month  1–3:   kWad = 10  × 1e18    (aggressive early incentive)
Month  4–6:   kWad =  5  × 1e18
Month  7–12:  kWad =  2  × 1e18
Month 13–24:  kWad =  1  × 1e18
Month 25–36:  kWad =  0.5 × 1e18
Month 37–48:  kWad =  0.25 × 1e18
Month 49+:    kWad =  0               (mining ends)
```

The schedule constants are baked in at deploy time (immutable; see §9 Constants). `RewardDistributor.currentK()` returns the schedule value for `block.timestamp` (no admin override).

**Monthly emission cap (front-loaded):**
```
Month  1–12:  monthly cap chosen so cumulative ≤ 200M PSYH (50% of mining allocation)
Month 13–24:  cumulative ≤ 320M PSYH (+30%)
Month 25–36:  cumulative ≤ 370M PSYH (+12.5%)
Month 37–48:  cumulative ≤ 400M PSYH (+7.5%, completing the bucket)
```

Per-month caps are derived by the `RewardDistributor` contract from these tier totals (e.g., months 1–12 each get `200M / 12 ≈ 16.67M PSYH`). Implementation detail.

**Reservation model (decision 7).** Cap enforcement is **at reservation time, not at claim time**. When settlement starts (Pass 3 finalization), `PredictionEngine` calls:

```solidity
RewardDistributor.reserveRewards(bountyId, P1_rawTotal + P2_total)
  → returns (uint256 reservedAmount, uint256 effectiveKWad)
```

The function reads `currentK()`, computes the requested allocation, clamps it to whatever monthly-cap headroom remains, and **decrements the month's cap accounting in storage immediately**. The returned `effectiveKWad` may be less than `currentK()` if the cap was approached — but is **the same `kWad` for every predictor in this bounty**, locked at reservation. Subsequent `assignRewards()` and `claimTokens()` calls do not re-check the cap; they only consume against `reservedAmount`.

This eliminates V0.30's race condition where a late `claimTokens()` for an old bounty could be reduced because a newer high-volume bounty later in the same month consumed the cap. Each bounty's `kWad` is fixed at reservation; the cap is always evaluated against the bounty that arrived first.

If `reserveRewards` is called and the month's cap is fully exhausted (`effectiveKWad == 0`), the bounty proceeds to settlement with **zero Pool 3 reward** (Pool 1 and Pool 2 still distribute normally). The `KCoefficientObserved(month, 0)` event is emitted for off-chain monitoring (see §10.3 events block).

### 6.5 Buyback & Burn

**Source of buyback funds:**
- 1% platform fee from Pool 1 (collected per-prediction at submission, see §5.7)
- 20% of Pool 2 (transferred at settlement)
- Accumulated in `Treasury` as USDC under categories `FEE` and `BUYBACK` respectively. For buyback purposes both categories aggregate into the **buyback pool** balance returned by `Treasury.pendingBuybackBalance()`.

**Buyback execution — rolling geometric smoothing (decision 2):**

`BuybackExecutor` runs weekly. Each epoch spends `1/BUYBACK_EPOCH_COUNT == 1/12` of the Treasury's *current* buyback-pool balance:

```
spendThisEpoch = pendingBuybackBalance() × 1 / BUYBACK_EPOCH_COUNT      // i.e. /12
```

This is a **rolling geometric smoothing mechanism**, not a strict tranche queue. New inflows simply add to `pendingBuybackBalance` and are consumed at the same proportional rate. The model has no per-tranche state and no cleanup logic. Properties:

- **Half-life of any incoming dollar is approximately 8 epochs** (≈ 8 weeks) — `(11/12)^8 ≈ 0.50`.
- **After 12 epochs, approximately 65 % of any one inflow has been spent** — `1 - (11/12)^12 ≈ 0.65`.
- The remainder asymptotes toward zero as further epochs run.
- Long-run effect: each USDC of inflow is fully consumed in PSYH burns over many epochs, but no individual epoch is dominated by any single inflow.

L1.C ratified this model over an alternative tranche-queue accounting that would achieve strict 12-epoch linear consumption. Tranche queue was rejected as over-engineered for V0.3 — it would require per-tranche storage, active tranche cleanup, and gas growth proportional to inflow count. The simpler `currentBalance × 1/12` model achieves the product goal of "smooth buy pressure, no single-epoch market shock" with a single state variable.

Execution uses Uniswap V3 or CoW Protocol with TWAP; exact venue choice and slippage parameters are decided in L2-T5b BuybackExecutor (subtask T5.2). All PSYH bought back is **burned** (100% burn). Treasury does not retain buyback PSYH.

**Before Phase 3 (DEX listing):**
- Buyback pool accumulates USDC. No buybacks execute until `BuybackExecutor.activate()` is called by `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` after DEX liquidity is seeded. Phase 1 / Phase 2 thus build up a buyback war chest that is consumed once Phase 3 begins.

### 6.6 Token Utility Summary

Phase 1: reward only (accumulation, no transfer).  
Phase 2: transfer enabled (gift, send, but no on-chain liquidity).  
Phase 3: DEX liquidity seeded. Buybacks activate.  
Phase 4 (future): governance voting, staking, challenge mechanisms.

---

## 7. Phased Rollout

### 7.1 Phase 1 — Closed Accumulation (Month 0–3)

- Core protocol live: propositions, predictions, resolution, settlement, claim.
- `PsychohistoryToken` deployed. Minting active (via `RewardDistributor`). Transfers **disabled**.
- Users accumulate tokens as internal score balance. Front-end shows a "locked tokens" indicator.
- Treasury accumulates USDC from fees and Pool 2 allocations. Buybacks inactive.
- Team manually curates propositions. No sponsor self-service yet (optional).

### 7.2 Phase 2 — Transfer Unlock (Month 3–6)

- `TRANSFER_CONTROLLER_ROLE` flips `_transfersEnabled = true`.
- Tokens can be sent wallet-to-wallet. No DEX yet.
- OTC trades and informal markets may emerge. This is acceptable.
- Treasury continues accumulating USDC. No buybacks yet (no DEX liquidity to buy from).

### 7.3 Phase 3 — DEX Launch (Month 6+)

- Team creates initial Uniswap V3 liquidity pool: `PSYH / USDC`.
  - Liquidity seeded from: Liquidity Reserve bucket (10% of supply = 100M PSYH) + Treasury USDC balance.
  - Initial price set by team to be below expected market clearing price, allowing upward discovery.
- `BuybackExecutor.activate()` called.
- Weekly TWAP buyback + burn cycle begins.
- Sponsor self-service creation may be opened (subject to product readiness).

### 7.4 Phase 4 — Decentralization (Month 12+)

- Deferred. Covered by future TDDs. Includes:
  - Decentralized challenge mechanisms for proposition quality and fact submission
  - On-chain governance activation (DAO formation)
  - Deprecation of team-curated proposition creation in favor of permissionless creation with challenge periods
  - Oracle decentralization

---

## 8. Sponsor Mechanics

### 8.1 Lifecycle

Sponsors deposit USDC at any time between `openTimestamp` and `closeTimestamp`. Deposits are **additive** — a sponsor may call `addSponsorship()` multiple times, each call increases their `contributionAmount` cumulatively.

**Sponsor count cap (decision 4).** Each bounty enforces a hard limit of `MAX_SPONSORS_PER_BOUNTY = 100` distinct sponsor addresses. The 101st distinct address calling `addSponsorship()` reverts with `SponsorCapReached`. Existing sponsors may still increase their contribution after the cap is reached; only new sponsor enrollment is blocked. Rationale: V0.3 sorts sponsors on-chain at `closeTimestamp` (§8.2); a 100-element sort fits comfortably within block gas limits, while removing the need for an off-chain hint + verification protocol. If/when V0.3 launch traffic demonstrates demand for >100-sponsor bounties, V0.4 may upgrade to an off-chain sorted hint with on-chain pagination verification (analogous to §11 cutoff hint).

At `closeTimestamp`, sponsor contributions are frozen. `BountyManager.finalizeSponsorRanking(bountyId)` (callable by `PREDICTION_ENGINE_ROLE` or any caller after close) sorts the ≤ 100 sponsors descending by `contributionAmount`, assigns `rank` (0 = top), `tier`, and `accessUnlockTimestamp` per §8.2. Sort uses an in-memory pass plus `mstore` of sorted addresses; ties broken by earlier `submittedAt`, falling back to address numeric order.

### 8.2 Tiered Data Access — Service Tier, Not Information Tier

In V0.3 prediction data is on-chain transparent (see §1, §12.4). Tiered "access" therefore refers to **service-priority delivery of curated aggregate analytics**, not exclusive cryptographic access to information. The on-chain ranking + timestamps record an immutable commitment by the protocol team / data service to deliver per-tier service within the listed window.

After `closeTimestamp` but before `publicAccessTimestamp` (= bounty's `resolutionDeadline` for V0.3), the off-chain analytics service progressively delivers aggregate-statistics packages to sponsors:

- **Tier 1 (day 1):** top 1 sponsor by contribution
- **Tier 2 (day 2):** next 2 sponsors (ranks 2–3)
- **Tier 3 (day 3):** next 3 sponsors (ranks 4–6)
- **Tier N (day N):** next N sponsors
- **Final tier:** all remaining sponsors, no per-tier cap (day N+1 or earliest reached when all sponsors are seated)
- **Public:** everyone, at `publicAccessTimestamp`

**Rule:** Tier `k` has capacity for `k` sponsors. If fewer sponsors exist than capacity, the sequence collapses — sponsors fill tiers 1, 2, 3 in order until all are placed. Tier timing still uses day-indexing (tier `k` opens on day `k`). With the 100-sponsor cap, the deepest possible tier is `k = 13` (1 + 2 + ... + 13 = 91 < 100 ≤ 1 + 2 + ... + 14 = 105), so settlements complete within ~2 weeks of close in worst case.

**What sponsors actually receive (the "service" they pay for):**

- Pre-computed `wagerWeightedDistribution` ready in clean schema (JSON / CSV / Parquet) on standardized API endpoint
- `predictionCount`, `totalWager`, plus per-option / per-bucket sub-aggregates
- Optional: time-series aggregates by sub-window, percentile breakdowns, predictor cohort analysis (premium tiers)
- SLA on freshness ("within X minutes of close for Tier 1, etc.")
- Optional: human/AI analyst Q&A priority (highest tiers)

A sponsor who refuses the service can replicate the on-chain aggregation themselves (see §1 persona note: ~$5K–$50K engineering + maintenance). The service tier's value is convenience and SLA; the auction equilibrium price reflects this convenience premium.

**Implementation:** the on-chain `BountyManager` records sponsor ranking + tier timestamps immutably. The **off-chain service** is operated by the team in V0.3 (later may be opened to multiple service providers). On-chain accountability for service delivery is out of scope for this TDD.

### 8.3 Aggregated Data Content

The aggregate-statistics delivered by the service consists of (at minimum):

- `wagerWeightedDistribution`: for each option (discrete) or value histogram bucket (numerical), the sum of `effectiveWager` placed. This is the market-implied probability distribution weighted by skin-in-the-game.
- `predictionCount`: number of unique predictors.
- `totalWager`: sum of `effectiveWager` (or `rawWager`, both versions provided).
- `submittedAt` distribution: temporal breakdown of when wagers entered.

Individual predictor identities are visible on-chain (V0.3, decision 1) but the off-chain service does NOT highlight them; sponsors interested in pseudonym-level data can derive it from chain themselves.

Higher-tier service may include richer aggregates (cohort, percentile, time-series) as a product differentiator — these are not in the on-chain spec.

### 8.4 Sponsor Refund

Sponsors can reclaim deposits in exactly these cases:

| Trigger | `BountyState` precondition | Refund event `reasonCode` |
|---|---|---|
| Oracle calls `resolveAsInvalid` (proposition was malformed / unknowable) | `Invalidated` | `INVALIDATED` |
| Admin cancels before any prediction or sponsorship exists | `Cancelled` | `CANCELLED` |
| `totalPredictors == 0` at `resolutionDeadline` (no signal generated) | `Settled` (terminal, with refund predicate) | `NO_SIGNAL` |

Sponsors **cannot** reclaim when settlement proceeds normally with at least one predictor. The 40% of Pool 2 they pay in platform take (20% buyback + 10% team + 10% DAO) is the cost of the analytics service plus protocol overhead.

The `NO_SIGNAL` case is operationally distinct from `INVALIDATED`: the proposition was *resolvable* (oracle could have submitted an outcome) but no predictor staked, so no aggregate signal was produced. We treat it as refund-eligible because the sponsor's purpose (buying signal) was unmet. The `BountyState` does **not** need a new enum value for this; the refund predicate `(state == Invalidated) || (state == Cancelled) || (state == Settled && totalPredictors == 0)` is sufficient and the event `reasonCode` carries the semantic distinction.

**Sponsor refund supersedes V0.30 §5.9 ambiguity.** V0.30 §5.9 contained contradictory language — the lead paragraph said sponsors get no refund on zero-predictor bounties, then the footnote contradicted by enabling refund. V0.31 unifies on **refund** per the table above; this is also consistent with V0.30 §8.4. See §5.9 for the corresponding edge-case settlement flow.

The PE-mutator block (`recordPrediction` / `closeBounty` / `markResolved` / `markInvalidated` / `markSettled`) is new in V0.31 — V0.30 implicitly assumed these but never specified them, leaving the BountyManager / PredictionEngine boundary undefined. T1.3 must add the corresponding `PREDICTION_ENGINE_ROLE` modifier on each.

### 10.3 IRewardDistributor

V0.31 rewrites this interface around a **reserve / assign / finalize / claim** lifecycle. The cap is consumed at reservation time (when settlement begins), guaranteeing each predictor in a given bounty sees the **same** `effectiveKWad`. Late claims do not contend with newer bounties.

```solidity
interface IRewardDistributor {
    // ─── Events ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

        uint256 effectiveKWad          // K_wad value clamped to remaining cap
    );
    event RewardsAssigned(uint256 indexed bountyId, address indexed predictor, uint256 amount);
    event RewardsFinalized(uint256 indexed bountyId, uint256 totalAssigned, uint256 unassignedReturned);
    event TokensClaimed(uint256 indexed bountyId, address indexed claimant, uint256 minted);

    // ─── Claim (caller: predictor directly OR PredictionEngine.claim) ────────

    /// @notice Mint assigned PSYH to predictor (one-shot). Reverts if already claimed for

    /// @notice Cap headroom remaining for the current month, AFTER all current reservations.
    function monthlyCapRemaining() external view returns (uint256);
}
```

> **Note on V0.30 → V0.31 delta.** V0.30 had a single `distributeRewards` taking `(bountyId, predictors[], amounts[])` plus `claimTokens`. The cap check happened lazily inside `claimTokens`. That model created a race where late claimers could be reduced because newer bounties consumed the month's cap first. V0.31's reserve-at-start model fixes this. Migration from V0.30 implementations is non-trivial and is captured in T0 spec lock and T3.2 redesign.

## 11. Settlement Algorithm (Paginated)

The most complex function in the protocol. Specification is normative — implementation must match exactly.

**Input:** `bountyId`, `startIndex`, `endIndex`. Each `settle()` call processes the predictor range `[startIndex, endIndex)` within the *current* pass.

**Precondition:** `SettlementState.resolved == true` and `SettlementState.isInvalidated == false`. Bounty state must be `Resolved` (not yet `Settled`).

**Zero-predictor short-circuit.** If `Bounty.totalPredictors == 0`, the very first `settle()` call after `resolve()` skips all 4 passes, transitions Bounty to `Settled`, emits `NoSignalSettled`, and returns. Sponsors can then call `claimSponsorshipRefund()` per §8.4.

**High-level: a four-pass algorithm split across multiple `settle()` calls.** Because Solidity has no cheap sort and unbounded loops are gas-hazardous, settlement is paginated within each pass and gated between passes by `currentPass` / `passCompletedFlags`.

### State machinery (mirrors §9 SettlementState)

```
currentPass        // 0 (uninitialized / pre-Pass-1) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 — pass settle() is advancing
settledUpTo        // pagination cursor within currentPass; reset to 0 when pass advances
passCompletedFlags // bit i set when pass i complete (bit 0 = Pass 1, bit 1 = Pass 2, …)
```

`currentPass == 0` is the implicit pre-settlement state on a freshly resolved bounty. The first `settle()` call lazily advances it to 1 (or short-circuits to Settled if `totalPredictors == 0`). Pass advancement: when `settledUpTo == totalPredictors` for a given pass, the contract:

1. Sets the corresponding bit in `passCompletedFlags`.
2. Increments `currentPass` to the next pass.
3. Resets `settledUpTo` to 0.
4. Performs any once-per-pass aggregate finalization (e.g., Pass 2 hint verification, Pass 3 reservation).

The next `settle()` call enters the next pass.

### State initialization and mirroring

`SettlementState` is zero-initialized (Solidity default) at bounty creation. Over the bounty lifecycle:

| Trigger | Caller | `SettlementState` fields written |
|---|---|---|
| `PredictionEngine.resolve(bountyId, value, decimals)` | ORACLE_ROLE → PE; PE calls `BountyManager.markResolved` AND writes own state | `resolved = true`, `resolvedValue = value`, `resolvedDecimals = decimals` |
| `PredictionEngine.resolveAsInvalid(bountyId)` | ORACLE_ROLE → PE; PE calls `BountyManager.markInvalidated` | `isInvalidated = true` |
| First `settle()` after `resolve()` (non-zero predictors) | anyone → PE | `currentPass` lazily advances 0 → 1 |
| First `settle()` after `resolve()` (zero predictors) | anyone → PE | `fullySettled = true`, then `BountyManager.markSettled(bountyId, 0)`; emits `NoSignalSettled` |
| Pass advancement | PE inside `settle()` | `passCompletedFlags`, `currentPass`, `settledUpTo` reset; once-per-pass aggregates (see Pass-specific sections) |
| `submitCutoffHint` (Step 2A) | anyone → PE | `cutoffHintScore`, `cutoffHintSubmitted = true`; on overwrite path also zero `cutoffStrictlyAboveCount`, `cutoffAtCutoffCount`, `settledUpTo` |
| Pass 2 verification success | PE inside `settle()` | `topGroupCutoffScore`, `topGroupCount` |
| Pass 3 finalization | PE inside `settle()` | `p1TopPrincipal`, `p1RemainderAmount`, `p1SumTopScoreEffWager`, `p2SumTopScoreEffWager`, `p2SumBottomScoreEffWager`, `reservedTokenAllocation`, `effectiveKWad` |
| Pass 4 / Final Finalization | PE inside `settle()` | `sumPool1PayoutTop` (accumulated across pages), `fullySettled = true` on the final page |

`SettlementState` lives in PredictionEngine storage. `Bounty.state` (in BountyManager) is the authoritative bounty-state machine; the `resolved` / `isInvalidated` flags on `SettlementState` are PE-local convenience mirrors set in the same transaction as the corresponding BM mutator.

### Events emitted during settlement

All events are declared on `IPredictionEngine` (§10.2) unless noted.

| Event | Emitted at |
|---|---|
| `CutoffHintSubmitted(bountyId, cutoffScore, submitter)` | Step 2A success (incl. overwrite of a previously failed hint) |
| `CutoffHintVerified(bountyId, cutoffScore, topGroupCount)` | Pass 2 final-page verification check passes |
| `SettlementProgressed(bountyId, currentPass, settledUpTo, totalPredictors)` | End of every `settle()` call that **did not** complete a pass. Off-chain consumers use this to observe pagination progress. |
| `NoSignalSettled(bountyId)` | Zero-predictor short-circuit on the first `settle()` after `resolve()` |
| `SettlementComplete(bountyId, topGroupCount)` | Final finalization (Pass 4 → Settled) |
| `RewardsReserved` / `RewardsAssigned` / `RewardsFinalized` | Emitted by `IRewardDistributor` (§10.3) on `reserveRewards` / `assignRewards` / `finalizeRewards` calls during Pass 3 + Final Finalization |
| `PayoutClaimed(bountyId, predictor, usdcAmount, tokenAmount)` | `claim()` |

### Pass 1 — Score Computation

For each prediction in `[startIndex, endIndex)` of `predictorList[bountyId]`:

1. Compute `score`:
   - Discrete: `score = (2 × WAD) - computeCategoricalBrierScore(confidenceWadArray, resolvedOptionIndex)`. `resolvedOptionIndex = uint256(bounty.resolvedValue)`; require `bounty.resolvedValue >= 0` (asserted at markResolved per ADR-0009).
   - Numerical (V0.32 / ADR-0009 supports signed):
     ```
     rawError = SignedMath.abs(predictedValueWad - resolvedValueWad)   // both int256, returns uint256
     score    = WAD_SQUARED / max(rawError, MIN_BRIER)
     ```
   Both yield high-is-better scores in `[0, 2 × WAD]` (Discrete) or `[0, WAD_SQUARED / MIN_BRIER]` (Numerical, much larger range but same direction).
2. Store `score` in the `Prediction` struct via `_getPrediction(bountyId, predictor)` indirection (decision 1, hook D).
3. Increment `settledUpTo`.

When `settledUpTo == totalPredictors`, set `passCompletedFlags |= 0b0001`, advance to Pass 2, reset cursor.

### Pass 2 — Cutoff Hint Submission and Verification

This pass uses a **permissionless off-chain hint + on-chain paginated verification** model (decision 4 of L1.B; cutoff hint trust is fixed to permissionless in V0.31, no oracle gate, no bond). Per V0.31 Opt-α, top-group membership is **not** persisted on the `Prediction` struct during Pass 2; only the per-bounty counters in `SettlementState` are mutated. Pass 3 / Pass 4 derive top-group membership lazily as `score >= topGroupCutoffScore`. This keeps Pass 2 idempotent across hint replacements: a failed hint costs no per-prediction storage rollback.

**Step 2A — Hint submission (anyone, callable while Pass 1 is complete and Pass 2 is not yet verified).** `submitCutoffHint(bountyId, cutoffScore)` semantics:

- Reverts if Pass 1 has not completed (`passCompletedFlags & 0b0001 == 0`).
- Reverts if Pass 2 verification has already succeeded (`passCompletedFlags & 0b0010 != 0`).
- If `cutoffHintSubmitted == true` AND the new `cutoffScore` matches the pending one: idempotent (no state change).
- Otherwise (no pending hint, OR pending hint differs): writes `cutoffHintScore = cutoffScore`, sets `cutoffHintSubmitted = true`, and **resets** the Pass 2 cursor and counters: `cutoffStrictlyAboveCount = 0`, `cutoffAtCutoffCount = 0`, `settledUpTo = 0`. Emits `CutoffHintSubmitted(bountyId, cutoffScore, msg.sender)`.

A hint that fails Step 2B's final-page verification revert is therefore naturally **replaceable**: any party calls `submitCutoffHint` again with a corrected score; the per-bounty counters reset to zero, and Step 2B re-runs paginated against the new hint. No `Prediction`-struct rollback is needed (because Step 2B writes none).

**Step 2B — Paginated verification (called via `settle(bountyId, startIndex, endIndex)` while `currentPass == 2`).** For each prediction in `[startIndex, endIndex)`:

1. Read the prediction's `score` from storage (set in Pass 1).
2. If `score > cutoffHintScore`: increment `cutoffStrictlyAboveCount`.
3. If `score == cutoffHintScore`: increment `cutoffAtCutoffCount`.
4. Increment `settledUpTo`.

(No write to the `Prediction` struct in this pass — Opt-α design; see §9 Prediction note.)

When `settledUpTo == totalPredictors`, perform the verification check:

```
n = totalPredictors
targetCount = ceil(n / 2) = (n + 1) / 2

// Count of predictions in the top group under the proposed hint
topCount = cutoffStrictlyAboveCount + cutoffAtCutoffCount

require(cutoffStrictlyAboveCount <= targetCount, "hint too low");
require(topCount >= targetCount, "hint too high");
```

If both pass: set `topGroupCutoffScore = cutoffHintScore`, `topGroupCount = topCount`, set `passCompletedFlags |= 0b0010`, emit `CutoffHintVerified(bountyId, cutoffScore, topCount)`, advance to Pass 3 (`currentPass = 3`, `settledUpTo = 0`).

If either check fails: **revert**. The submitter (or any subsequent party) calls `submitCutoffHint` again with a corrected `cutoffScore` — Step 2A semantics zero out the counters and `settledUpTo`, and Step 2B restarts from index 0 against the new hint. **DoS asymmetry**: an attacker pays full gas per failed `submitCutoffHint` + partial Step 2B verification before revert; the defender's correct hint resolves the bounty permanently. This permissionless-no-bond design is deemed sufficient for V0.3 launch (see §12.5); if observed in production, V0.4 may introduce a refundable bond.

### Pass 3 — Accumulator Pass + Reservation

For each prediction in `[startIndex, endIndex)`:

1. Compute top-group membership lazily: `inTopGroup_i = (prediction.score >= SettlementState.topGroupCutoffScore)`. Per V0.31 Opt-α, this is **not** persisted on the `Prediction` struct — it is re-derived in every pass that needs it. The cost is one storage read of `topGroupCutoffScore` per `settle()` call (hot after first access in the same transaction) plus one comparison per prediction.
2. If `inTopGroup_i`:
   - `p1TopPrincipal += effectiveWager`
   - `p1SumTopScoreEffWager += (score × effectiveWager) / WAD`
   - `p2SumTopScoreEffWager += (score × effectiveWager) / WAD`
3. Else (in bottom group):
   - `p2SumBottomScoreEffWager += (score × effectiveWager) / WAD`
4. Increment `settledUpTo`.

When `settledUpTo == totalPredictors`, perform once-per-bounty finalization:

**Compute global amounts (using §9 Bounty / §5.7 fields):**

```
p1RawTotal       = bounty.totalRawWagerAmount
p1EffectiveTotal = bounty.totalEffectiveWagerAmount
p1Remainder      = p1EffectiveTotal - p1TopPrincipal       // ≥ 0 by construction (§5.4)

p2Total          = bounty.totalSponsorAmount
p2Consolation    = mulDiv(p2Total, P2_CONSOLATION_BPS, BPS)
p2Victory        = mulDiv(p2Total, P2_VICTORY_BPS, BPS)
p2Buyback        = mulDiv(p2Total, P2_BUYBACK_BPS, BPS)
p2Team           = mulDiv(p2Total, P2_TEAM_BPS, BPS)
p2Dao            = p2Total - p2Consolation - p2Victory - p2Buyback - p2Team   // exact remainder, no rounding loss
```

**Reserve Pool 3 allocation against monthly cap:**

```
(reservedTokenAllocation, effectiveKWad) =
    RewardDistributor.reserveRewards(bountyId, p1RawTotal + p2Total)
```

This consumes the month's cap headroom *now*, before any per-predictor amounts are computed. See §6.4 / §10.3 reserve-at-start model.

Set `passCompletedFlags |= 0b0100`, advance to Pass 4.

### Pass 4 — Per-Predictor Payout Assignment

Pass 4 reads three persisted aggregates (`p1RemainderAmount`, `p1SumTopScoreEffWager`, `p2SumTopScoreEffWager`, `p2SumBottomScoreEffWager` on `SettlementState`) and **recomputes** the Pool 2 splits (`p2Consolation`, `p2Victory`, etc.) at the entry of each `settle()` call from `bounty.totalSponsorAmount` and the `P2_*_BPS` constants. These splits are deterministic functions of immutable inputs; recomputing per call is cheaper (a few `mulDiv`s) than persisting five additional `SettlementState` slots.

For each prediction in `[startIndex, endIndex)`:

Compute top-group membership lazily: `inTopGroup_i = (prediction.score >= SettlementState.topGroupCutoffScore)` (Opt-α; not stored).

If `inTopGroup_i`:
```
remainderShare = mulDiv(p1Remainder,
                         score × effectiveWager,
                         p1SumTopScoreEffWager × WAD)         // score-0 fallback if denominator == 0

victoryBonus   = mulDiv(p2Victory,
                         score × effectiveWager,
                         p2SumTopScoreEffWager × WAD)         // score-0 fallback if denominator == 0

pool1Payout_i  = effectiveWager + remainderShare              // §5.4

usdcPayout     = pool1Payout_i + victoryBonus
```

Else:
```
consolation    = mulDiv(p2Consolation,
                         score × effectiveWager,
                         p2SumBottomScoreEffWager × WAD)      // score-0 fallback as in §5.5

usdcPayout     = consolation
pool1Payout_i  = 0
```

Accumulate `sumPool1PayoutTop += pool1Payout_i` (only for top group). Store `prediction.usdcPayout = usdcPayout`. Set `prediction.processed = true`. Increment `settledUpTo`.

### Final Finalization (triggered on the call that completes Pass 4)

When `settledUpTo == totalPredictors` in Pass 4:

> **V0.32 (ADR-0008): Pool 3 amount slice formula updated.** All Pool 3 distribution now multiplies by `score`, aligning with Brier philosophy and the [Forecaster Scoreboard](L1-PLAN.md#project-thesis--forecaster-scoreboard) thesis. The amount slice formula is now `(alloc/2) × (score_i × pool1Payout_i) / Σ(score_j × pool1Payout_j)`. See updated formula in §5.6 and the per-predictor Pool 3 computation block below.
> **V0.32 (ADR-0010): Forecaster stats update.** Pass 4 / Final Finalization (only on successful settlement, NOT on Invalidated / Cancelled / NoSignal paths) updates `forecasterStats[predictor]` for each predictor in this bounty. See per-predictor accumulator step.

1. **Transfer Pool 2 slices and dust:**
   - `Treasury.receivePoolFunds(bountyId, p2Buyback,   CAT_BUYBACK)`
   - `Treasury.receivePoolFunds(bountyId, p2Dao,       CAT_DAO)`
   - Direct USDC `transfer` to team wallet for `p2Team`
   - If `B = ∅` (i.e., `topGroupCount == totalPredictors`), `Treasury.receivePoolFunds(bountyId, p2Consolation, CAT_P2_UNALLOCATED)` — Slice A redirect (§5.5).
   - Note: the FEE category was already credited per-predictor at submission time (§5.7); not re-touched here.
   - Sweep accumulated rounding dust: `Treasury.receivePoolFunds(bountyId, dustAmount, CAT_DUST)`.

2. **Compute and assign Pool 3 rewards (paginated allowed; V0.32 / ADR-0008 score-aligned):**

To support the score-weighted amount slice, Pass 3 must additionally accumulate `p1SumTopScorePool1Payout = Σ (score_i × pool1Payout_i / WAD) for i ∈ T`. This is computed during the same per-predictor loop that produces `sumPool1PayoutTop` and incurs negligible additional gas (one `mulDiv` per top-group predictor).

```
totalAlloc      = reservedTokenAllocation
amountSlice     = totalAlloc / 2
qualitySlice    = totalAlloc - amountSlice                    // exact remainder

for each i in T:
    amountTokens_i  = mulDiv(amountSlice,
                              score_i × pool1Payout_i,
                              p1SumTopScorePool1Payout × WAD)
                      // V0.32 / ADR-0008: score-weighted (was just pool1Payout)
                      // score-0 fallback: weight by pool1Payout_i alone if denominator 0

    qualityTokens_i = mulDiv(qualitySlice,
                              score_i × effectiveWager_i,
                              p1SumTopScoreEffWager × WAD)
                      // score-0 fallback: weight by effectiveWager_i alone if denominator 0

    tokenReward_i   = amountTokens_i + qualityTokens_i
```

Then call `RewardDistributor.assignRewards(bountyId, predictors[T], amounts[T])`. This **may be paginated** in the same `settle()` call OR split across multiple final-finalization invocations if `|T|` is large; each call accumulates against `reservedTokenAllocation`. When all top-group predictors have been assigned, call `RewardDistributor.finalizeRewards(bountyId)`.

3. **Update forecaster stats (V0.32 / ADR-0010, only on successful settlement):**

For each predictor `i` in this bounty (NOT just top group — ALL participants):

```
forecasterStats[i].totalBountiesParticipated += 1
forecasterStats[i].totalRawWagerSubmitted    += rawWager_i
forecasterStats[i].totalEffectiveWagerSubmitted += effectiveWager_i
forecasterStats[i].totalScoreSum             += score_i
forecasterStats[i].totalScoreWeightedByWager += (score_i × effectiveWager_i) / WAD
if (i in T) forecasterStats[i].winsCount   += 1
forecasterStats[i].lastUpdatedAt              = block.timestamp
```

Updates only happen when reaching this Final Finalization step (i.e., a successful settlement with `totalPredictors > 0`). Invalidated, Cancelled, and NoSignal paths do NOT update forecaster stats.

This step may be paginated alongside `assignRewards` for large `|T|`; the stats update is per-predictor and idempotent within a single bounty's settlement (use `prediction.processed` flag to ensure each predictor counted once).

4. **Mark settled:**
   - `passCompletedFlags |= 0b1000`, `fullySettled = true`
   - `BountyManager.markSettled(bountyId, topGroupCount)`
   - Emit `SettlementComplete(bountyId, topGroupCount)`

### Gas Pagination Strategy

Each `settle()` call processes a caller-specified range. Callers (oracle, keeper bot, or any user) should batch in groups of **~50–100 predictors** per call to stay within block gas limit. The contract resumes from `settledUpTo` across calls and transparently advances `currentPass` when each pass completes.

Empirical batch tuning is implementation-time work in T4.3a–T4.3e.

### Removed / Renamed (V0.30 → V0.31)

- **Removed:** the `p1RemainderShareExcluded` term from V0.30 §11 Pass 4. The Pool 3 amount slice now weights by the explicit `pool1Payout_i = effectiveWager_i + remainderShare_i` defined in §5.4. See §5.6 note.
- **Removed:** the V0.30 hand-wave "or permissionless with bond" alternative on cutoff hint trust. V0.31 fixes this to permissionless (no bond).
- **Renamed:** `p1SumTopScoreWager` → `p1SumTopScoreEffWager` and analogous `p2*` accumulators, to make explicit that all multiplications use `effectiveWager` not `rawWager`.
- **Added:** Pass 3 reservation step (`RewardDistributor.reserveRewards`).
- **Added:** Final-finalization paginated assignment via `assignRewards` / `finalizeRewards` (replaces V0.30's monolithic `distributeRewards` array call).
- **Added:** explicit zero-predictor short-circuit at start of `settle()`.
- **Added:** Slice A → `CAT_P2_UNALLOCATED` redirect when `B = ∅`.

### Post-T0.B review revisions (V0.31 internal)

- **Removed:** `prediction.inTopGroup` storage field (was set in Pass 2). Top-group membership is now computed lazily in Pass 3 and Pass 4 as `score >= SettlementState.topGroupCutoffScore` (Opt-α design). Rationale: makes Pass 2 idempotent so failed cutoff hints can be replaced without per-prediction rollback.
- **Changed:** `submitCutoffHint` is now **replaceable** on verification failure. A new submission with a different score zeroes `cutoffStrictlyAboveCount`, `cutoffAtCutoffCount`, and `settledUpTo` so Pass 2 verification restarts from index 0. The previous "first-write-wins, fail → bounty stuck → oracle invalidate" path is removed.
- **Clarified:** Pass 4 / Final Finalization recomputes Pool 2 splits (`p2Consolation`, `p2Victory`, `p2Buyback`, `p2Team`, `p2Dao`) from `bounty.totalSponsorAmount` at each `settle()` entry rather than persisting them on `SettlementState`. Inputs are immutable; recompute is cheaper than 5 storage slots.
- **Added:** explicit `IPredictionEngine.closeBounty(bountyId)` passthrough (anyone, post-`closeTimestamp`) routing to `BountyManager.closeBounty` (PE-role-gated). Without this, the "anyone forces Open → Closed" path stated in §10.1 was inaccessible.

## 12. Security Considerations

### 12.1 Reentrancy
- Every function that moves tokens uses `nonReentrant`.
- CEI pattern throughout: state updates before external calls.
- `claim()` zeroes out `usdcPayout` and `tokenReward` before transfers.

### 12.2 Oracle Trust
- Single `ORACLE_ROLE` at launch. Future: oracle decentralization, dispute windows.
- Oracle can invalidate a proposition. This is a privileged operation; must be logged and monitored.

### 12.3 Sybil Attacks
- 1 USDC minimum wager partially mitigates spam.
- Same address cannot submit twice (enforced by `hasPredicted` mapping).
- Wallet-level Sybil (one user, many addresses) remains possible. Mitigated by:
  - Top-50% cutoff limits rewards to genuinely skilled predictions.
  - Token quality pool uses `score × effectiveWager` (§5.6), so a Sybil army with identical small wagers gets little per-address.
  - Future: optional Worldcoin / Gitcoin Passport integration.

### 12.4 On-Chain Transparency of Predictions (V0.3)

**V0.3 explicitly accepts that predictions are NOT private.** All fields of `Prediction` — `confidenceBpsArray`, `predictedValue`, `rawWager`, `effectiveWager`, `submittedAt` — live in unencrypted contract storage and are readable by anyone running an EVM RPC node or indexer. Front-ends MUST NOT represent prediction privacy as a security feature; the convention "the protocol's official UIs do not surface raw individual predictions" is a UX choice, not a security boundary.

**Front-running is still not a concern**, however. Brier scoring rewards calibrated probability distributions. A mempool observer who copies another predictor's distribution gains no advantage over that predictor — they end up at the same score. There is no "first-mover" or "alpha-leak" attack on prediction submission.

**The genuinely affected concern is sponsor auction value.** The V0.3 model intentionally trades cryptographic exclusivity for protocol simplicity (decision 1). Sponsors pay for the analytics service tier (§1, §8.2), not for information asymmetry. Sponsor auction equilibrium prices in V0.3 will reflect convenience and SLA value (estimated $5K–$50K range based on persona analysis), not the much larger prediction-information premium that an A-route protocol could capture.

**V0.4 upgrade hooks (decision 1, hooks A–E):**

V0.31 ships with the following architectural hooks so that an A-route privacy upgrade in V0.4 does not require protocol rewrite:

| Hook | Where | V0.3 behavior | V0.4 expectation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** `bytes encryptedPayload` parameter | `IPredictionEngine.submitPrediction` (§10.2), `Prediction` struct (§9) | `require(encryptedPayload.length == 0)` | Stores ciphertext encrypted to `Bounty.privacyMode`'s key/keyset |
| **B** `PrivacyMode` enum on `Bounty` | §9 `Bounty.privacyMode` | `require(privacyMode == PrivacyMode.Transparent)` at `createBounty` | May be `OracleEncrypted` or `ThresholdEncrypted` for high-value bounties |
| **C** `__gap` storage reservation | All upgradeable contracts (§2) | reserved | New encryption-related storage fields appended without breaking layout |
| **D** `_getPrediction(bountyId, predictor)` internal helper | `PredictionEngine` (§5.9, §11) | Returns plaintext directly | Routes through decryption based on `privacyMode` |
| **E** No batch-public predicate views | `IPredictionEngine` (§10.2) | `getPrediction` is single (bountyId, predictor) only; no `getAllPredictions` | Front-end behavior unchanged on V0.4; aggregate views remain off-chain |

These hooks are MANDATORY for V0.3 compliance. Skipping them turns V0.4 into a protocol rewrite rather than an upgrade.

**V0.3 oracle preemption risk.** Because predictions are transparent on-chain, the oracle (`ORACLE_ROLE`) can read all predictions before invoking `resolve()` and could in principle trade against them in external markets, or selectively `resolveAsInvalid()` based on which bounties are unfavorable to its pre-knowledge. Mitigation in V0.3 is a) operational — oracle held by team multisig with audit logging, b) trust assumption — protocol launches with declared centralized oracle and migrates toward decentralized oracle in Phase 4 (§7.4). This is the same trust assumption Polymarket and most prediction markets ship with at v1; not novel risk.

### 12.5 Settlement Manipulation

**Cutoff hint trust model (decision 4 of L1.B's settlement track,固化 in V0.31).** `submitCutoffHint` is permissionless. Anyone may submit a hint; the on-chain paginated verification (§11 Pass 2) catches any wrong hint deterministically by counting `score > hint` and `score >= hint`. The verification reverts the entire transaction if either bound is violated, returning the contract to the pre-Pass-2 state and consuming only the gas the prover paid.

V0.30 mentioned "oracle-only or permissionless with bond" — V0.31 removes both alternatives: no oracle trust dependency, no bond. Rationale: bond design is a non-trivial economic system (slash conditions, slash beneficiary, bond size) and offers no real protection beyond the on-chain verification's guarantee. Wrong hints simply waste their submitter's gas.

**Stuck-bounty edge case.** If no correct hint is ever submitted (e.g., due to UI bugs), the bounty hangs in Pass 2. In V0.3, the only recovery path is `ORACLE_ROLE.resolveAsInvalid` followed by full refund — same as if the resolution itself were flawed. V0.4 may add a hint-replace flow to recover gracefully.

**Settlement front-running is benign.** Anyone can call `settle()` and `claim()` on any bounty (after their own preconditions are met). Front-running these calls cannot extract value, only spend the front-runner's gas. `claim()` is already CEI-pattern protected against reentrancy (§12.1).

### 12.6 Token Inflation
- Mining schedule is hardcoded. Cannot be increased by admin.
- Monthly cap enforced at contract level.
- Team and DAO buckets have vesting or DAO-gate, preventing dumping.

### 12.7 Upgrade Safety
- All upgradeable contracts use OpenZeppelin's TransparentProxy with a dedicated ProxyAdmin.
- Storage layout: existing variables are never removed or reordered. New variables append at the end. `__gap` reduced accordingly on upgrade.
- Upgrade process documented in `docs/UPGRADE.md` (subtask).

### 12.8 Emergency Controls (V0.32 / ADRs 0011 / 0012 / 0013)

V0.32 adds three layered compensating controls in lieu of paid third-party audit (per S8 audit strategy):

- **TVL cap per bounty (ADR-0011):** `Bounty.tvlCap` defaults to 10,000 USDC raw. `submitPrediction` and `addSponsorship` revert with `BountyTvlCapExceeded` if accepting the amount would push `totalRawWagerAmount + totalSponsorAmount` above `tvlCap`. **Effect:** a single-bounty exploit's blast radius is bounded.
- **Emergency pause (ADR-0012):** all upgradeable contracts inherit `PausableUpgradeable`. `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` may halt new activity (entry-paths gated by `whenNotPaused`); **exit-paths (claim, refund, claimTokens) remain callable** so users can rescue funds during pause. **Effect:** vulnerability response without contract upgrade.
- **Withdrawal time-lock (ADR-0013):** during `launchPeriodActive` (initial 6 months), Treasury admin outflows go through `scheduleDaoWithdrawal` → `executeDaoWithdrawal` with 7-day delay. `cancelDaoWithdrawal` available to admin. After 6 months, `endLaunchPeriod()` can clear the time-lock for ergonomics. **Effect:** stolen admin keys give attacker 7 days; community has detection/response window.

These controls do not remove the need for AI multi-round review, static analysis (Slither, Aderyn, Mythril, Echidna), Foundry invariant testing, Immunefi bug bounty, and open-source disclosure path — they bound the worst-case loss if those measures fail.

---

## 13. Deployment Dependency Graph

V0.31 splits deployment into two scripts to mirror the §7 phased rollout. `BuybackExecutor` is **not** deployed in Phase 1; it is deployed only after Phase 3 DEX liquidity is seeded.

### 13.1 `script/DeployCore.s.sol` (Phase 1)

```
Step 1.  Deploy BrierMath (library, no proxy)
Step 2.  Deploy PsychohistoryToken (non-upgradeable ERC20 + ERC20Votes + ERC20Permit)
Step 3.  Deploy Treasury implementation + ProxyAdmin + TransparentProxy
           Initializer args: (USDC_ADDRESS, teamWallet, adminMultisig)
           V0.32 (ADR-0013): initializer also sets launchPeriodActive = true, deployedAt = block.timestamp.
Step 4.  Deploy RewardDistributor implementation + proxy
           Initializer args: (PSYH_ADDRESS, adminMultisig, deployTimestamp)
Step 5.  Deploy BountyManager implementation + proxy
           Initializer args: (USDC_ADDRESS, adminMultisig)
Step 6.  Deploy PredictionEngine implementation + proxy (linked against BrierMath)
           Initializer args: (BountyManager, RewardDistributor, Treasury, USDC_ADDRESS, oracleMultisig)
Step 7.  Deploy PsychohistoryRouter implementation + proxy
           Initializer args: (BountyManager, PredictionEngine)

Role grants (atomic, in same script):
  - Treasury.grantRole(PREDICTION_ENGINE_ROLE, PredictionEngine)
  - RewardDistributor.grantRole(PREDICTION_ENGINE_ROLE, PredictionEngine)
  - BountyManager.grantRole(PREDICTION_ENGINE_ROLE, PredictionEngine)
  - PsychohistoryToken.grantRole(MINTER_ROLE, RewardDistributor)
  - PsychohistoryToken.grantRole(TRANSFER_CONTROLLER_ROLE, adminMultisig)
  - PredictionEngine.grantRole(ORACLE_ROLE, oracleMultisig)
  - All contracts: DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE → adminMultisig

Output: deployments-core.json with all addresses, ProxyAdmin owners, role-grant txn hashes.
```

T6.1 acceptance criteria for `DeployCore`:

- All proxy initializer values verified against `deployments-core.json` post-deploy.
- ProxyAdmin contract owner equals `adminMultisig` (not the deployer EOA).
- Each role grant verified via `hasRole` view in a separate verification step.
- No leftover `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` on the deployer EOA (must transfer or revoke before script exits).

### 13.2 `script/DeployBuyback.s.sol` (Phase 3)

Run after DEX liquidity is seeded (Phase 3 onset):

```
Step 1.  Deploy BuybackExecutor implementation + proxy
           Initializer args: (Treasury, PSYH_ADDRESS, USDC_ADDRESS, dexRouter, slippageBps, adminMultisig)
Step 2.  Treasury.grantRole(TREASURY_EXECUTOR_ROLE, BuybackExecutor)
Step 3.  BuybackExecutor.activate()  ← starts the weekly epoch counter

Output: deployments-buyback.json appended to deployments-core.json.
```

T6.1 acceptance criteria for `DeployBuyback`:

- BuybackExecutor activated successfully (`isActivated() == true`).
- DEX router address sanity-checked against published Uniswap V3 / CoW Protocol router.
- First epoch correctly anchored to `block.timestamp`.

### 13.3 Cross-cutting deployment invariants

- Every upgradeable contract uses OpenZeppelin's `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` with a dedicated `ProxyAdmin` per contract (not a shared global admin).
- ProxyAdmin owner = `adminMultisig`, never the deployer.
- All initializer functions have `initializer` modifier, callable once.
- Total `MINTER_ROLE` holders on PsychohistoryToken at end of `DeployCore` = exactly 1 (RewardDistributor).
- Total `ORACLE_ROLE` holders on PredictionEngine at end of `DeployCore` = exactly 1 (oracleMultisig).
- Phase 1 ends with NO BuybackExecutor address granted any role anywhere.
- **V0.32 (ADR-0012):** all upgradeable contracts initialize as **unpaused** (`paused() == false`). DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE retains pause/unpause capability.
- **V0.32 (ADR-0013):** Treasury initializes with `launchPeriodActive == true` and `deployedAt == block.timestamp`. The `endLaunchPeriod()` function reverts until `block.timestamp >= deployedAt + LAUNCH_PERIOD_MIN_DURATION` (6 months) AND caller has DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE.

---

## 14. Testing Requirements

Each subtask (see §15) includes its own tests. Integration-level requirements:

### 14.1 Coverage and base scenarios

- **>90% line coverage** on all contracts (`forge coverage`).
- **Full settlement lifecycle test:** propose → deposit (multiple sponsors) → predict (≥ 20) → close → resolve → submit cutoff hint → paginated settle (multiple `settle()` calls across all 4 passes) → claim (USDC + PSYH for all winners + bottom-group consolation) → verify totals against invariants in §14.4.

### 14.2 Edge cases and refund paths

- **Invalidation test:** full flow ending in `resolveAsInvalid`. Verify each predictor receives back exactly `effectiveWager_i` (= `rawWager_i × 0.99`), NOT `rawWager_i` — the 1% submission fee is non-refundable per §5.8 (D1-b). Verify sponsors get 100% deposit refund. Verify `Treasury.categoryBalance(CAT_FEE)` for this bounty equals `Σ feeAmount_i` and is unchanged by `resolveAsInvalid`. `RefundReasonCode == INVALIDATED`.
- **Cancel test:** `cancelBounty` in Open state with no predictions / sponsorships — confirm cancellation; subsequent `addSponsorship` reverts.
- **No-signal test (V0.31 NEW):** create bounty + sponsor, no predictions submitted, `closeBounty` then `resolve()`, then `settle()` short-circuits to `Settled` with `NoSignalSettled` event; sponsors refundable with `reasonCode == NO_SIGNAL`.
- **Tie-handling test:** ≥ 20% of predictors score exactly at cutoff; verify all ties enter top group; `topGroupCount` exceeds `ceil(n/2)` by the tie span.
- **Edge: 1 predictor.** Must not revert. Single predictor enters top group. Pool 1 → return effectiveWager. Pool 2 Slice A → CAT_P2_UNALLOCATED. Pool 2 Slice B → all to predictor (or fallback to effectiveWager weight if score = 0).
- **Edge: all-tie.** All predictors enter top group. `B = ∅`. Pool 1 remainder = 0. Pool 2 Slice A → CAT_P2_UNALLOCATED.

### 14.3 V0.31-specific invariants

- **Per-predictor fee invariant (V0.31 NEW):** for every prediction, `rawWager == effectiveWager + feeAmount`, exact. Property test (≥ 1000 random submissions).
- **Effective-wager-only math invariant (V0.31 NEW):** in any settled bounty, `Σ pool1Payout_i for i ∈ T == Σ effectiveWager_i for all i` (modulo dust). Property: `rawWager` never appears as a coefficient in any pool math.
- **Score-0 fallback test (V0.31 NEW):** craft a Discrete bounty where every predictor's `confidenceBpsArray` puts 100% on the wrong option (so all Brier scores = 2 × WAD → score = 0). Verify Pool 2 Slice A and Pool 3 quality slice both fall back to effectiveWager weighting and complete settlement without revert.
- **Sponsor cap test (V0.31 NEW):** add 100 sponsors (each `addSponsorship` once); 101st `addSponsorship` from a NEW address reverts with `SponsorCapReached(bountyId, 100)` (declared as a Solidity custom error in §10.1, not an event); existing sponsor calling `addSponsorship` again succeeds.

- **Cutoff hint replacement test (V0.31 NEW, D2-b + Opt-α):** Pass 2 verification fails on a too-low hint (e.g., propose `cutoffScore = 0`, paginate, expect `"hint too low"` revert at final page). Submit a corrected hint via `submitCutoffHint` from a different address, then re-paginate Pass 2 — verify it succeeds. Assert no `Prediction.inTopGroup` storage was written or rolled back (the field does not exist in V0.31). Assert per-bounty counters reset to zero after the second `submitCutoffHint`. Assert `CutoffHintSubmitted` was emitted twice (once per submission).
- **Cutoff hint idempotent re-submission (V0.31 NEW):** call `submitCutoffHint(bountyId, X)` twice with the same `X` — second call is a no-op (no state change, no event).
- **`closeBounty` passthrough test (V0.31 NEW):** create bounty, advance time past `closeTimestamp` without any predictions or other actions, call `PredictionEngine.closeBounty(bountyId)` from a non-PE-role address — succeeds; `Bounty.state` transitions to `Closed`; subsequent `submitPrediction` reverts. Calling `closeBounty` before `closeTimestamp` reverts.
- **`finalizeSponsorRanking` gas test (V0.31 NEW):** with exactly 100 sponsors, measure gas; assert under 12M (well within block limit). With 101+ sponsors the test cannot reach this state because `addSponsorship` rejects.
- **`encryptedPayload` empty enforcement (V0.31 NEW):** all V0.3 `submitPrediction` calls with non-empty `encryptedPayload` revert. Property test with random byte arrays.
- **`PrivacyMode == Transparent` enforcement (V0.31 NEW):** `createBounty` with `OracleEncrypted` or `ThresholdEncrypted` reverts.
- **RewardDistributor reserve/assign/finalize (V0.31 NEW):**
  - Reserve consumes monthly cap headroom immediately.
  - Two bounties in the same month with combined `volumeUsdcRaw × kWad` exceeding cap: first bounty gets full `kWad`; second gets clamped `effectiveKWad < kWad` reflecting only remaining cap.
  - `assignRewards` cumulative sum cannot exceed `reservedAmount` (reverts).
  - `finalizeRewards` releases unassigned remainder back to monthly headroom; subsequent reservations in same month see the freed cap.
- **`claimTokens` after `finalizeRewards`** continues to work; cap check is NOT re-applied at claim time.
- **K-schedule tier transitions (V0.31 NEW):** `currentK()` returns correct `kWad` value at month boundaries (test `block.timestamp` exactly at month 4, month 7, month 13, etc.).
- **K = 0 at month 49+:** `reserveRewards` returns `effectiveKWad == 0` and `reservedAmount == 0`; settlement proceeds with zero Pool 3.

### 14.4 Conservation invariants

For any non-invalidated, non-cancelled, non-no-signal settled bounty:

```
Σ_predictors usdcPayout_i
+ p2Buyback (to Treasury CAT_BUYBACK)
+ p2Team    (to teamWallet)
+ p2Dao     (to Treasury CAT_DAO)
+ slice_A_redirect_if_B_empty (to Treasury CAT_P2_UNALLOCATED, else 0)
+ dust      (to Treasury CAT_DUST)
==
totalEffectiveWagerAmount + totalSponsorAmount
```

Plus the FEE invariant:

```
Σ_predictors feeAmount_i == bounty.totalFeeCollected
                          == Treasury.categoryBalance(CAT_FEE) attributable to this bounty
```

(Off-bounty FEE accumulation also possible from other bounties; the per-bounty assertion uses event-stream tracing, not pure balance.)

### 14.5 Buyback test (decision 2 model)

- **Buyback geometric model test:** seed Treasury with 1200 USDC under CAT_BUYBACK, no further inflows, run 12 epochs:
  - Epoch 1: spends 100, balance 1100.
  - Epoch 2: spends `1100/12 ≈ 91.67`, balance ≈ 1008.33.
  - …
  - Verify balance after 12 epochs ≈ `1200 × (11/12)^12 ≈ 421` (i.e. ~ 65% spent), NOT zero. This is the V0.31 expected behavior (decision 2).
  - All bought-back PSYH burned (verify `totalSupply` decreased by `psyhBought` per epoch).
- **Buyback inflow during decay test:** seed 1200, epoch-1 spend 100, then add 1200 more at epoch-2; verify epoch-2 spend == `(1100 + 1200)/12 ≈ 191.67`. Confirms inflows enter the same rolling pool.

### 14.6 State machine and access control

- **Open → Closed transition:** `closeBounty` callable at/after `closeTimestamp`; idempotent.
- **PE-only mutators:** every BountyManager mutator from §10.1 reverts when called by non-`PREDICTION_ENGINE_ROLE` accounts.
- **Refund predicate:** `claimSponsorshipRefund` rejects when bounty is in any non-refundable state (Open, Closed, Resolved with predictors > 0, Settled with predictors > 0).

### 14.7 V0.32 ADR-driven new tests

- **ADR-0008 — Brier-aligned amount slice (V0.32 NEW):** create a bounty with 3 top-group predictors having very different scores but identical pool1Payout. Verify that under V0.32 formula, the predictor with highest `score` receives proportionally more amount-slice tokens than under V0.31's pool1Payout-only formula.
- **ADR-0009 — int256 negative numerical (V0.32 NEW):**
  - Create a Numerical bounty with resolved value = -50000 (e.g., signed election margin)
  - Predictor submits `predictedValue = -45000`
  - Verify `rawError = 5000` (computed via SignedMath.abs)
  - Verify `score = WAD_SQUARED / max(rawError × WAD-conversion, MIN_BRIER)` is correct
  - Verify resolve() rejects negative resolvedValue when bounty.propositionType == Discrete
- **ADR-0010 — Forecaster stats accumulation (V0.32 NEW):**
  - Predictor participates in 3 successful bounties: scores [10, 20, 30] / wagers [1e6, 2e6, 3e6]
  - Verify `forecasterStats[predictor].totalBountiesParticipated == 3`
  - Verify `totalScoreSum == 60`
  - Verify `totalScoreWeightedByWager == (10*1e6 + 20*2e6 + 30*3e6) / 1e18` modulo precision
  - Verify `winsCount` matches actual top-group entries
  - **Invariant:** stats NOT updated for an Invalidated bounty (predictor's totalBountiesParticipated stays unchanged after Invalidation refund flow)
- **ADR-0011 — TVL cap enforcement (V0.32 NEW):**
  - Create bounty with `tvlCap = 10_000 × 1e6` ($10K)
  - Sponsor deposits $5K, predictor submits $4.5K → total $9.5K, accepted
  - Predictor submits $1K → total would be $10.5K, reverts with `BountyTvlCapExceeded(bountyId, 10_500_000_000, 10_000_000_000)`
  - Mirror test for `addSponsorship` exceeding cap
  - Test `tvlCap = 0` parameter at createBounty maps to `MAX_BOUNTY_TVL_CAP_DEFAULT`
- **ADR-0012 — Pause behavior (V0.32 NEW):**
  - Admin pauses; verify `submitPrediction`, `addSponsorship`, `createBounty`, `settle`, `submitCutoffHint` revert with `EnforcedPause` error
  - Verify `claim`, `claimSponsorshipRefund`, `claimTokens` still callable during pause
  - Admin unpauses; verify entry-paths work again
  - Non-admin attempt to pause reverts
- **ADR-0013 — Withdrawal time-lock (V0.32 NEW):**
  - Schedule withdrawal at t=0; advance time +6 days; execute reverts (still under timelock)
  - Advance to t=7 days +1 sec; execute succeeds
  - Cancel pending withdrawal; verify `executeDaoWithdrawal` reverts after cancel
  - Verify `daoWithdraw` (legacy) reverts while `launchPeriodActive == true`
  - Advance time +6 months +1 day; admin calls `endLaunchPeriod()`; verify pending withdrawals still respect their own time-lock; new `daoWithdraw` calls execute immediately
  - Verify `endLaunchPeriod()` reverts before 6 months elapsed
  - Verify `endLaunchPeriod()` reverts when called by non-admin

## 15. Subtask Decomposition

These are the recommended subtasks for parallel development in independent conversations. Each subtask should have this TDD attached as context. Dependencies flow downward; siblings at the same level can be developed in parallel.

### Tier 1 — Foundations (sequential)

**T1.1 Project scaffolding**
- Initialize Foundry project, install OpenZeppelin dependencies
- Set up remappings and compiler config
- Directory structure: `src/core/`, `src/libraries/`, `src/interfaces/`, `src/mocks/`, `test/`, `script/`
- Acceptance: `forge build` succeeds on empty project

**T1.2 Shared types and constants**
- `src/libraries/PsychohistoryTypes.sol`: all enums and structs from §9
- `src/libraries/Constants.sol`: all constants from §9
- Acceptance: `forge build` succeeds; no warnings

**T1.3 All interface files**
- Complete `IBountyManager`, `IPredictionEngine`, `IRewardDistributor`, `ITreasury`, `IBuybackExecutor`, `IPsychohistoryToken`
- Full NatSpec
- Acceptance: `forge build` succeeds; interfaces compile against mock implementations

### Tier 2 — Math and Token (parallel)

**T2.1 BrierMath library**
- Implement all functions from §5.2
- Comprehensive unit tests + fuzz tests
- Acceptance: `forge test --match-path test/BrierMath.t.sol` passes with >95% coverage

**T2.2 PsychohistoryToken**
- ERC20 + ERC20Votes + ERC20Permit (OpenZeppelin)
- Non-upgradeable
- Transfer gating with `_transfersEnabled` flag
- `MINTER_ROLE` for minting; `TRANSFER_CONTROLLER_ROLE` for flag toggle
- Total supply hard cap enforced in `mint()`
- Acceptance: transfer gating test, minting permission test, supply cap test, vote delegation test

### Tier 3 — Core Modules (partial parallelism)

**T3.1 Treasury**
- Proxy-upgradeable
- Category-labeled fund receipt for `CAT_FEE / CAT_BUYBACK / CAT_DAO / CAT_DUST / CAT_P2_UNALLOCATED` (§10.4)
- DAO sub-account accounting (incl. `CAT_P2_UNALLOCATED` per decision 3)
- `pendingBuybackBalance()` and `pullBuybackForEpoch()` hooks (BuybackExecutor pulls per epoch; epoch tracking authoritative on Treasury side, see §10.4 V0.31 delta)
- Depends on: T1.1, T1.2, T1.3

**T3.2 RewardDistributor**
- Proxy-upgradeable
- Implements `reserveRewards / assignRewards / finalizeRewards / claimTokens` lifecycle (§10.3)
- K schedule per §6.4; `effectiveKWad` clamped to monthly-cap headroom **at reservation time** (decision 7), not at claim time
- Tracks per-bounty `(reservedAmount, effectiveKWad)`; monthly cap consumed at `reserveRewards`
- `claimTokens()` mints from PsychohistoryToken on demand against `mintingCapRemaining` (decision 5: mint-on-demand, not pre-mint)
- Depends on: T1.1, T1.2, T1.3, T2.2 (token address)

**T3.3 BountyManager**
- Proxy-upgradeable
- Proposition lifecycle and state machine
- Sponsor ranking and tier assignment (§8)
- `claimSponsorshipRefund()` for invalidation and zero-predictor cases
- Depends on: T1.1, T1.2, T1.3

### Tier 4 — PredictionEngine (heaviest)

**T4.1 PredictionEngine — Storage and submission**
- Proxy-upgradeable
- **Acceptance, first criterion (V0.31 NEW):** Before implementing submission logic, define and compile the full PredictionEngine storage layout required by T4.1–T4.4, including settlement pass state and reward accounting fields. Later T4.x tasks may append only with L2 approval.
- `submitPrediction()` with Discrete/Numerical validation; per-predictor 1% fee deduction (§5.7); `encryptedPayload` length-zero enforcement
- Calls `BountyManager.recordPrediction` via PE→BM mutator
- Depends on: T3.3 (BountyManager) finalized

**T4.2 PredictionEngine — Resolution**
- `resolve()` with outcome validation; calls `BountyManager.markResolved`
- `resolveAsInvalid()`; calls `BountyManager.markInvalidated`
- Explicit `closeBounty()` passthrough (Open → Closed)
- Depends on: T4.1

**T4.3 PredictionEngine — Settlement (V0.31: 5-segment split)**

Original V0.30 T4.3 covered §11 all 4 passes + Pool 1/2/3 — too heavy for one L3 conversation. V0.31 splits into 5 sub-tasks:

- **T4.3a Pass 1 (score computation + pagination)** — depends on T4.2, T2.1
- **T4.3b Pass 2 (cutoff hint submission + paginated verification + top group flagging)** — depends on T4.3a
- **T4.3c Pass 3 (accumulator pass + global amount commitment + reserveRewards call)** — depends on T4.3b
- **T4.3d Pass 4 (per-predictor USDC payout assignment)** — depends on T4.3c
- **T4.3e Final finalization (Pool 2 transfers + paginated assignRewards + finalizeRewards + markSettled)** — depends on T4.3d, T3.1, T3.2

**T4.4 PredictionEngine — Claim**
- `claim()`: transfers USDC payout AND calls `RewardDistributor.claimTokens` for atomic USDC + PSYH delivery
- Double-claim protection
- Depends on: T4.3e

### Tier 5 — Router and Buyback (V0.31: split L2-T5a + L2-T5b)

V0.30's L2-T5 grouped Router + BuybackExecutor with no shared dependency. V0.31 splits:

**L2-T5a — PsychohistoryRouter**
- T5.1: atomic multi-step operations (`createBountyAndPredict`, `predictAndSponsor`, etc.)
- Depends on: T4.4, T3.3

**L2-T5b — BuybackExecutor (parallel to entire L2-T4)**
- T5.2: epoch-based geometric buyback (§6.5 model: `currentBalance × 1/12` per epoch)
- L2-T5b.A first decision: DEX venue (Uniswap V3 vs. CoW Protocol vs. both)
- Burn on receipt (100%)
- Depends on: T3.1, T2.2

### Tier 6 — Deployment and Simulation

**T6.1 Deployment script**
- `script/DeployCore.s.sol` (Phase 1: token, Treasury, RewardDistributor, BountyManager, PredictionEngine, Router) per §13.1
- `script/DeployBuyback.s.sol` (Phase 3: BuybackExecutor activation) per §13.2
- Supports local Anvil and Sepolia
- Outputs `deployments.json` (Phase 1 emits, Phase 3 augments)

**T6.2 Integration tests**
- `test/Integration.t.sol`: all scenarios from §14
- Depends on: all Tier 1–5 tasks

**T6.3 Simulation script**
- `script/Simulation.s.sol`: full end-to-end on testnet
- Depends on: T6.1

### Tier 7 — Security Review (final)

**T7.1 Static analysis**
- Slither + Aderyn configured
- Report reviewed, false positives documented

**T7.2 Invariant testing**
- Foundry invariants: total supply, pool sum conservation, top-group cardinality
- Handler-based stateful fuzzing

## 16. Open Questions and Deferred Decisions

The following decisions are intentionally deferred to avoid premature complexity:

1. **Sponsor data delivery mechanism.** The contract records tier and timestamp, but actual data hand-off (email, dashboard, API) is off-chain. Off-chain system design is not part of this TDD.
2. **Proposition metadata standard.** `metadataURI` points to IPFS JSON. Schema (question text, option labels, units, source oracle URL) should be defined in a separate product spec.
3. **Front-end architecture.** Not part of this TDD. Will need a Next.js app or similar that integrates with Privy (embedded wallets) and the contracts.
4. **Challenge and dispute mechanisms.** Phase 4 scope. Not addressed here.
5. **Cross-chain strategy.** Single chain at launch. Multi-chain via LayerZero or Wormhole is a future upgrade.
6. **KYC for high-value sponsors.** Not enforced on-chain. Could be required off-chain as a condition of team curation service.

## 17. Changelog vs V2

This section is for historical context, in case existing V2 code is referenced.

| Concern | V2 | V3 (this doc) |
|---|---|---|
| Prediction types | Binary, Categorical, Numerical (3 types) | Discrete (N ≥ 2), Numerical (2 types) |
| Prediction input | `selectedOption + confidenceBps` (Categorical) | `confidenceBpsArray` only |
| Stake | Fixed 10 USDC per prediction | Free-form wager, min 1 USDC |
| Pool structure | Single pool (sponsor bounty only) | Three pools: predictor wager, sponsor, token |
| Bottom-50% handling | Total slash to Treasury | Consolation slice from sponsor pool |
| Sponsor mechanics | Static bounty, no bidding | Cumulative bidding with tiered access |
| Token mechanics | vePSYH boost, delegation | Prediction mining + buyback/burn |
| Philosophy | Pure knowledge-purchase | Hybrid PvP + sponsor signal market |

Existing V2 code should not be incrementally modified into V3. This is a ground-up rewrite. V2 is preserved as a separate repository for historical reference.

**End of TDD**

The Claude Code master planning conversation should use this document as the authoritative reference when decomposing work into subtask conversations. Each subtask conversation should be given:
1. The relevant sections of this TDD (not the whole thing, to preserve context budget)
2. The specific acceptance criteria from §15
3. Permission to reference this TDD when encountering ambiguity
